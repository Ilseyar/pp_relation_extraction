Cytohesin-1 regulates beta-2 integrin-mediated adhesion through both ARF-GEF function and interaction with LFA-1 Here we provide evidence of how cytohesin-1 , an integrin-binding protein and guanine-nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) for ARF GTPases , regulates cell adhesion Mutational analyses of the beta-2 cytoplasmic domain revealed that the adhesive function of LFA-1 depends on its interaction with cytohesin-1 , unless the integrin is activated by exogenous divalent cations Secondly , cytohesin-1 induces expression of an extracellular activation epitope of LFA-1 , and the exchange factor function is not essential for this activity In contrast , LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 is strongly inhibited by a cytohesin-1 mutant , which fails to catalyze ARF GDP-GTP exchange in vitro Thus , $T1$ is involved in the activation of $T2$ , most probably through direct interaction with the integrin , and induces cell spreading by its ARF-GEF activity

We tested this point by cotransfecting CHO cells with the genes encoding F beta alpha and the CG beta subunit or the CG beta alpha and FSH beta monomer The formation of a functional single chain/subunit complex was not restricted to the FSH single chain/CG beta subunit since CG single chain interacts with the monomeric FSH beta subunit and exhibits FSH activity This is relevant for the case of LH and FSH , because both are synthesized in the same cell ( i.e. , pituitary gonadotrophs ) and several of the alpha subunit sequences required for association with either the $T1$ or $T2$ subunits are different Previously , we showed that the CG beta or FSH beta subunit genes can be genetically fused to the alpha gene to produce biologically active single chains , CG beta alpha and F beta alpha , respectively
