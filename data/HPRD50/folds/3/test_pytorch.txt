Suppression of rat thromboxane synthase gene transcription by $T1$ in macrophages via an interaction with $T2$ Deletion analysis showed that the element responsible for the PPARgamma effect is located in a region containing the nuclear factor E2 (NF-E2)/AP-1 site (-98/-88), which was indicated to be the major promoter of the TXS gene By electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear extracts from macrophages, we observed a specific protein-DNA complex formation, which was inhibited by a specific antibody against the transcription factor NRF2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) Finally, a direct interaction between PPARgamma and NRF2 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay

Cross-linking of CD53 with the use of the mAb MEM-53 and a polyclonal sheep anti-mouse Ig promoted activation of resting B cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle as judged by increased expression of the early activation Ag CD69, increases in cellular volume, RNA synthesis, and c-myc protein levels, and enhanced binding of 7-aminoactinomycin D However, cytokines, in particular $T1$$T2$ protein levels, and enhanced binding of 7-aminoactinomycin D However, cytokines, in particular IL-2 and IL-4, potentiated the DNA synthesis induced by cross-linking of CD53

Herein, we show that a distinct IkappaB protein Bcl3 also interacts with RXR, as shown in the yeast two-hybrid tests and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays In contrast to IkappaBbeta, Bcl3 did not interact with the AF2 domain of RXR Bcl3 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors $T1$, TBP, and TFIIA but not with TFIIEalpha in the GST pull-down assays TBP and TFIIA, however, were not able to interact with IkappaBbeta Accordingly, Bcl3 coactivated the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR, in contrast to the inhibitory actions of IkappaBbeta In addition, coexpression of $T2$ but not p300 further stimulated the Bcl3-mediated enhancement of the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR

We report that MSH2 (MutS homolog 2) protein interacts with the ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) kinase to form a signaling module and regulate the phosphorylation of Chk1 and SMC1 (structure maintenance of chromosome 1) We found that phosphorylation of $T1$ by ATR also requires checkpoint proteins $T2$ and replication protein A In contrast, phosphorylation of SMC1 by ATR is independent of Rad17 and replication protein A, suggesting that the signaling pathway leading to SMC1 phosphorylation is distinct from that mediated by the checkpoint proteins In addition, both MSH2 and Rad17 are required for the activation of the S-phase checkpoint to suppress DNA synthesis in response to MNNG, and phosphorylation of SMC1 is required for cellular survival
