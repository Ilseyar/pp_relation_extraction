The protein pVHL functions in a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Hif1 alpha for proteasomal degradation during normoxia We establish that pVHL binds to Tat-binding protein-1 (TBP-1), a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and Hif1 alpha in vivo Overexpression of TBP-1 promotes degradation of $T1$ in a pVHL-dependent manner that requires the ATPase domain of $T2$ Blockade of TBP-1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) causes prolonged degradation kinetics of Hif1 alpha Several distinct mutations in exon 2 of VHL disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP-1 A pVHL mutant containing a P154L substitution coimmunoprecipitates with Hif1 alpha, but not TBP-1, and does not promote degradation of Hif1 alpha Thus, the ability of pVHL to degrade Hif1 alpha depends in part on its interaction with TBP-1 and suggests a new mechanism for Hif1 alpha stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors

In the present study, we observed evidence of cross-talk between the cannabinoid receptor $T1$ and the $T2$ (OX1R) using a heterologous system In contrast to OX1R, the potency of direct activation of CB1 was not affected by co-expression with OX1R In addition, electron microscopy experiments revealed that CB1 and OX1R are closely apposed at the plasma membrane level; they are close enough to form hetero-oligomers

GC-GAP, a Rho family GTPase-activating protein that interacts with signaling adapters Gab1 and Gab2 Gab1 and $T1$ are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42 Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active $T2$ and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA
