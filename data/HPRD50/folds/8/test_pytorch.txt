The transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1 interacts with p120(ctn) The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1, also known as CD148, is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells, in a variety of tumor cell lines, and in lymphocytes $T1$ also interacted with other members of the catenin gene family including $T2$ and gamma-catenin The interaction with p120(ctn) is likely to be direct, as the interaction occurs in K562 cells lacking functional adherens junctions and E-cadherin expression Catalytic domains of the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-PEST, CD45, and PTPbeta did not interact with proteins of the catenin family to detectable levels, suggesting that the interaction of DEP1 with these proteins is specific

p300/cAMP-response-element-binding-protein ('$T1$')-binding protein (CBP) modulates co-operation between myocyte enhancer factor 2A ($T2$) and thyroid hormone receptor-retinoid X receptor p300/cAMP-response-element-binding-protein ('CREB')-binding protein (CBP) interacting with transcription factors is able to increase their activity on target gene promoters Our findings showed that the same C-terminal portion of p300 binds the N-terminal domains of both TR and MEF2A, and our in vivo studies demonstrated that TR, MEF2A and p300 form a ternary complex

Differential binding of vascular cell-derived proteoglycans (perlecan, biglycan, decorin, and versican) to the beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan, a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan, to the beta-amyloid protein (A beta)-containing amyloid deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain Overall, the results indicate that specific vascular cell-derived $T1$ differentially interact with A beta, and that the interactions of highest affinity occur between A beta and binding sites on both the core protein and glycosaminoglycan chains of perlecan In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived PGs to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits may be due to its interactions with perlecan Pretreatment of AA amyloidotic splenic and liver tissue sections with synthetic A beta (1-28) produced strong immunoreactivity with A beta antibodies at tissue sites enriched in perlecan which was partially removed by pretreatment with heparitinase, but not by chondroitin $T2$ lyase [35S]-Sulfate labeled proteoglycans (PGs) derived from cultured ECs and SMCs bound to affinity columns containing A beta (1-28) or (1-40), with virtually no binding to A beta (40-1) (reverse peptide), beta-amyloid precursor protein (410-429), or bovine serum albumin Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by decorin and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
