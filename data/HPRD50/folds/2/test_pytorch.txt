Suppression of rat thromboxane synthase gene transcription by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in macrophages via an interaction with NRF2 Deletion analysis showed that the element responsible for the PPARgamma effect is located in a region containing the nuclear factor E2 (NF-E2)/AP-1 site (-98/-88), which was indicated to be the major promoter of the TXS gene By electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the $T1$$T2$ in macrophages via an interaction with NRF2 Deletion analysis showed that the element responsible for the PPARgamma effect is located in a region containing the nuclear factor E2 (NF-E2)/AP-1 site (-98/-88), which was indicated to be the major promoter of the TXS gene By electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear extracts from macrophages, we observed a specific protein-DNA complex formation, which was inhibited by a specific antibody against the transcription factor NRF2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) Finally, a direct interaction between PPARgamma and NRF2 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay

The protein pVHL functions in a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Hif1 alpha for proteasomal degradation during normoxia We establish that pVHL binds to $T1$ (TBP-1), a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and Hif1 alpha in vivo Overexpression of TBP-1 promotes degradation of Hif1 alpha in a pVHL-dependent manner that requires the ATPase domain of TBP-1 Blockade of TBP-1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) causes prolonged degradation kinetics of Hif1 alpha Several distinct mutations in exon 2 of $T2$ disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP-1 A pVHL mutant containing a P154L substitution coimmunoprecipitates with Hif1 alpha, but not TBP-1, and does not promote degradation of Hif1 alpha Thus, the ability of pVHL to degrade Hif1 alpha depends in part on its interaction with TBP-1 and suggests a new mechanism for Hif1 alpha stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors

We report that MSH2 (MutS homolog 2) protein interacts with the ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) kinase to form a signaling module and regulate the phosphorylation of Chk1 and SMC1 (structure maintenance of chromosome 1) We found that phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR also requires checkpoint proteins Rad17 and replication protein A In contrast, phosphorylation of $T1$ by ATR is independent of $T2$ and replication protein A, suggesting that the signaling pathway leading to SMC1 phosphorylation is distinct from that mediated by the checkpoint proteins In addition, both MSH2 and Rad17 are required for the activation of the S-phase checkpoint to suppress DNA synthesis in response to MNNG, and phosphorylation of SMC1 is required for cellular survival

Modification of de novo DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) by SUMO-1 modulates its interaction with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and its capacity to repress transcription Here we show that Dnmt3a interacts with multiple components of the sumoylation machinery, namely the E2 sumo conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and the E3 sumo ligases PIAS1 and PIASxalpha, all of which are involved in conjugating the small ubiquitin-like modifier polypeptide, SUMO-1, to its target proteins Dnmt3a is modified by SUMO-1 in vivo and in vitro and the region of Dnmt3a responsible for interaction maps to the N-terminal regulatory domain Functionally, sumoylation of $T1$ disrupts its ability to interact with histone deacetylases ($T2$/2), but not with another interaction partner, Dnmt3b

The protein pVHL functions in a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Hif1 alpha for proteasomal degradation during normoxia We establish that pVHL binds to $T1$ (TBP-1), a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and $T2$ in vivo Overexpression of TBP-1 promotes degradation of Hif1 alpha in a pVHL-dependent manner that requires the ATPase domain of TBP-1 Blockade of TBP-1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) causes prolonged degradation kinetics of Hif1 alpha Several distinct mutations in exon 2 of VHL disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP-1 A pVHL mutant containing a P154L substitution coimmunoprecipitates with Hif1 alpha, but not TBP-1, and does not promote degradation of Hif1 alpha Thus, the ability of pVHL to degrade Hif1 alpha depends in part on its interaction with TBP-1 and suggests a new mechanism for Hif1 alpha stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors

Subsequent amino acid sequencing revealed many peptides involving $T1$ cross-linked either to itself or to a variety of other known CE protein components, including cystatin alpha, desmoplakin, elafin, keratins, members of the small proline-rich superfamily, $T2$, and unknown proteins related to the desmoplakin family Specific glutamines or lysines of involucrin were used to cross-link the different proteins, such as glutamines 495 and 496 to desmoplakin, glutamine 288 to keratins, and lysines 468, 485, and 508 and glutamines 465 and 489 for interchain involucrin cross-links

Here, we cloned and characterized a mouse orthologue of human KIAA1427 protein as an atypical Syt (named Syt XIII) Subcellular fractionation and antibody-uptake experiments indicate that $T1$ is indeed a type-I membrane protein, but, unlike other $T2$ isoforms, lacks an N-terminal extracellular domain

Suppression of rat thromboxane synthase gene transcription by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in macrophages via an interaction with NRF2 Deletion analysis showed that the element responsible for the PPARgamma effect is located in a region containing the nuclear factor E2 (NF-E2)/AP-1 site (-98/-88), which was indicated to be the major promoter of the TXS gene By electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear extracts from macrophages, we observed a specific protein-DNA complex formation, which was inhibited by a specific antibody against the transcription factor $T1$ (NF-E2-related factor 2) Finally, a direct interaction between PPARgamma and NRF2 was confirmed by $T2$ pull-down assay

We report that MSH2 (MutS homolog 2) protein interacts with the ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) kinase to form a signaling module and regulate the phosphorylation of Chk1 and SMC1 (structure maintenance of chromosome 1) We found that phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR also requires checkpoint proteins Rad17 and replication protein A In contrast, phosphorylation of SMC1 by ATR is independent of $T1$ and replication protein A, suggesting that the signaling pathway leading to SMC1 phosphorylation is distinct from that mediated by the checkpoint proteins In addition, both $T2$ and Rad17 are required for the activation of the S-phase checkpoint to suppress DNA synthesis in response to MNNG, and phosphorylation of SMC1 is required for cellular survival

The human $T1$ and Imp4 proteins form a ternary complex with hMpp10, which only interacts with the U3 $T2$ in 60-80S ribonucleoprotein complexes We have cloned cDNAs encoding the human and mouse homologs of the yeast U3 snoRNP-associated proteins Imp3 and Imp4 The results of complementation experiments show that, in contrast to mouse Imp4, mouse Imp3 can partially alleviate the growth defect of the corresponding yeast null strain, indicating that the role of Imp3 in pre-rRNA processing is evolutionarily conserved The results of density gradient centrifugation experiments show that, in contrast to hU3-55K, the human Imp3 and Imp4 proteins predominantly interact with the U3 snoRNA in 60-80S ribonucleoprotein complexes
