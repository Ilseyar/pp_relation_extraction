Identification of residues in the monocyte chemotactic protein-1 that contact the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2 The receptor binding site of MCP-1 also is significantly different from the binding sites of RANTES and IL-8, providing insight into the issue of receptor specificity It was previously shown that the N-terminus of CCR2 is critical for binding MCP-1 To identify the regions of $T1$ that contact its receptor, $T2$, we substituted all surface-exposed residues with alanine

Subsequent amino acid sequencing revealed many peptides involving involucrin cross-linked either to itself or to a variety of other known CE protein components, including cystatin alpha, desmoplakin, $T1$$T2$, desmoplakin, elafin, keratins, members of the small proline-rich superfamily, loricrin, and unknown proteins related to the desmoplakin family Specific glutamines or lysines of involucrin were used to cross-link the different proteins, such as glutamines 495 and 496 to desmoplakin, glutamine 288 to keratins, and lysines 468, 485, and 508 and glutamines 465 and 489 for interchain involucrin cross-links
