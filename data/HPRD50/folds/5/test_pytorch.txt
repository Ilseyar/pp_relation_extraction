Here we demonstrate colocalization and direct interaction between $T1$ and $T2$ Overexpression of CLIP-170 results in a zinc finger-dependent localization of a phospho-LIS1 isoform and dynactin to MT bundles, raising the possibility that CLIP-170 and LIS1 regulate dynein/dynactin binding to MTs This work suggests that LIS1 is a regulated adapter between CLIP-170 and cytoplasmic dynein at sites involved in cargo-MT loading, and/or in the control of MT dynamics

The protein pVHL functions in a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Hif1 alpha for proteasomal degradation during normoxia We establish that $T1$ binds to Tat-binding protein-1 ($T2$), a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and Hif1 alpha in vivo Overexpression of TBP-1 promotes degradation of Hif1 alpha in a pVHL-dependent manner that requires the ATPase domain of TBP-1 Blockade of TBP-1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) causes prolonged degradation kinetics of Hif1 alpha Several distinct mutations in exon 2 of VHL disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP-1 A pVHL mutant containing a P154L substitution coimmunoprecipitates with Hif1 alpha, but not TBP-1, and does not promote degradation of Hif1 alpha Thus, the ability of pVHL to degrade Hif1 alpha depends in part on its interaction with TBP-1 and suggests a new mechanism for Hif1 alpha stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors

Herein, we show that a distinct IkappaB protein Bcl3 also interacts with RXR, as shown in the yeast two-hybrid tests and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays In contrast to IkappaBbeta, Bcl3 did not interact with the AF2 domain of RXR $T1$ specifically interacted with the general transcription factors TFIIB, TBP, and $T2$ but not with TFIIEalpha in the GST pull-down assays TBP and TFIIA, however, were not able to interact with IkappaBbeta Accordingly, Bcl3 coactivated the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR, in contrast to the inhibitory actions of IkappaBbeta In addition, coexpression of SRC-1 but not p300 further stimulated the Bcl3-mediated enhancement of the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR
