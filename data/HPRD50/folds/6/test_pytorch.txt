Differential binding of vascular cell-derived proteoglycans (perlecan, biglycan, decorin, and versican) to the beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan, a specific $T1$$T2$) to the beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan, a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan, to the beta-amyloid protein (A beta)-containing amyloid deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain Overall, the results indicate that specific vascular cell-derived PGs differentially interact with A beta, and that the interactions of highest affinity occur between A beta and binding sites on both the core protein and glycosaminoglycan chains of perlecan In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived PGs to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits may be due to its interactions with perlecan Pretreatment of AA amyloidotic splenic and liver tissue sections with synthetic A beta (1-28) produced strong immunoreactivity with A beta antibodies at tissue sites enriched in perlecan which was partially removed by pretreatment with heparitinase, but not by chondroitin ABC lyase [35S]-Sulfate labeled proteoglycans (PGs) derived from cultured ECs and SMCs bound to affinity columns containing A beta (1-28) or (1-40), with virtually no binding to A beta (40-1) (reverse peptide), beta-amyloid precursor protein (410-429), or bovine serum albumin Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by decorin and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan

GC-GAP, a Rho family GTPase-activating protein that interacts with signaling adapters Gab1 and Gab2 Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro The protein was named $T1$ for its ability to interact with $T2$ proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42 Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA

Differential binding of vascular cell-derived proteoglycans (perlecan, biglycan, decorin, and versican) to the beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan, a specific $T1$$T2$, a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan, to the beta-amyloid protein (A beta)-containing amyloid deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain Overall, the results indicate that specific vascular cell-derived PGs differentially interact with A beta, and that the interactions of highest affinity occur between A beta and binding sites on both the core protein and glycosaminoglycan chains of perlecan In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived PGs to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits may be due to its interactions with perlecan Pretreatment of AA amyloidotic splenic and liver tissue sections with synthetic A beta (1-28) produced strong immunoreactivity with A beta antibodies at tissue sites enriched in perlecan which was partially removed by pretreatment with heparitinase, but not by chondroitin ABC lyase [35S]-Sulfate labeled proteoglycans (PGs) derived from cultured ECs and SMCs bound to affinity columns containing A beta (1-28) or (1-40), with virtually no binding to A beta (40-1) (reverse peptide), beta-amyloid precursor protein (410-429), or bovine serum albumin Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by decorin and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan

Cutting edge: CD43 functions as a T cell counterreceptor for the macrophage adhesion receptor $T1$ (Siglec-1) The 130- and 240-kDa sialoadhesin-binding glycoproteins were identified as the sialomucins CD43 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 ($T2$), respectively CD43 expressed in COS cells supported increased binding to immobilized sialoadhesin Finally, sialoadhesin bound different glycoforms of CD43 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, including unbranched (core 1) and branched (core 2) O:-linked glycans, that are normally found on CD43 in resting and activated T cells, respectively These results identify CD43 as a T cell counterreceptor for sialoadhesin and suggest that in addition to its anti-adhesive role CD43 may promote cell-cell interactions
