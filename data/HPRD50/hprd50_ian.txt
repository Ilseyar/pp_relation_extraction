Modification of de novo DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) by SUMO-1 modulates its interaction with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and its capacity to repress transcription Here we show that Dnmt3a interacts with multiple components of the sumoylation machinery, namely the E2 sumo conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and the E3 sumo ligases entity1_term and entity2_term, all of which are involved in conjugating the small ubiquitin-like modifier polypeptide, SUMO-1, to its target proteins Dnmt3a is modified by SUMO-1 in vivo and in vitro and the region of Dnmt3a responsible for interaction maps to the N-terminal regulatory domain Functionally, sumoylation of Dnmt3a disrupts its ability to interact with histone deacetylases (HDAC1/2), but not with another interaction partner, Dnmt3b

Here we demonstrate colocalization and direct interaction between CLIP-170 and LIS1 Overexpression of CLIP-170 results in a zinc finger-dependent localization of a phospho-LIS1 isoform and dynactin to MT bundles, raising the possibility that CLIP-170 and LIS1 regulate dynein/dynactin binding to MTs This work suggests that entity1_term is a regulated adapter between entity2_term and cytoplasmic dynein at sites involved in cargo-MT loading, and/or in the control of MT dynamics

GC-GAP, a Rho family GTPase-activating protein that interacts with signaling adapters Gab1 and Gab2 Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, entity1_term, Shc, and Crk In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42 Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and entity2_term levels but not RhoA

GC-GAP, a Rho family GTPase-activating protein that interacts with signaling adapters Gab1 and Gab2 Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length entity1_term in vitro We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned entity2_term and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42 Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA

Cutting edge: CD43 functions as a T cell counterreceptor for the macrophage adhesion receptor sialoadhesin (Siglec-1) The 130- and 240-kDa sialoadhesin-binding glycoproteins were identified as the sialomucins CD43 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (CD162), respectively CD43 expressed in COS cells supported increased binding to immobilized sialoadhesin Finally, entity1_term bound different glycoforms of entity2_term expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, including unbranched (core 1) and branched (core 2) O:-linked glycans, that are normally found on CD43 in resting and activated T cells, respectively These results identify CD43 as a T cell counterreceptor for sialoadhesin and suggest that in addition to its anti-adhesive role CD43 may promote cell-cell interactions

Differential binding of vascular cell-derived proteoglycans (perlecan, biglycan, decorin, and versican) to the beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan, a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan, to the beta-amyloid protein (A beta)-containing amyloid deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain Overall, the results indicate that specific vascular cell-derived PGs differentially interact with A beta, and that the interactions of highest affinity occur between A beta and binding sites on both the core protein and glycosaminoglycan chains of perlecan In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived PGs to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits may be due to its interactions with perlecan Pretreatment of AA amyloidotic splenic and liver tissue sections with synthetic A beta (1-28) produced strong immunoreactivity with A beta antibodies at tissue sites enriched in perlecan which was partially removed by pretreatment with heparitinase, but not by chondroitin entity1_term lyase [35S]-Sulfate labeled proteoglycans (PGs) derived from cultured ECs and SMCs bound to affinity columns containing A beta (1-28) or (1-40), with virtually no binding to A beta (40-1) (reverse peptide), beta-amyloid precursor protein (410-429), or bovine serum albumin Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by entity2_term and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan

The transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1 interacts with p120(ctn) The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1, also known as CD148, is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells, in a variety of tumor cell lines, and in lymphocytes DEP1 also interacted with other members of the catenin gene family including entity1_term and gamma-catenin The interaction with p120(ctn) is likely to be direct, as the interaction occurs in K562 cells lacking functional adherens junctions and E-cadherin expression Catalytic domains of the tyrosine phosphatases entity2_term, CD45, and PTPbeta did not interact with proteins of the catenin family to detectable levels, suggesting that the interaction of DEP1 with these proteins is specific

Cytohesin-1 regulates beta-2 integrin-mediated adhesion through both ARF-GEF function and interaction with LFA-1 Here we provide evidence of how cytohesin-1, an integrin-binding protein and guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF GTPases, regulates cell adhesion Mutational analyses of the beta-2 cytoplasmic domain revealed that the adhesive function of LFA-1 depends on its interaction with cytohesin-1, unless the integrin is activated by exogenous divalent cations Secondly, cytohesin-1 induces expression of an extracellular activation epitope of LFA-1, and the exchange factor function is not essential for this activity In contrast, LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 is strongly inhibited by a cytohesin-1 mutant, which fails to catalyze ARF GDP-GTP exchange in vitro Thus, entity1_term is involved in the activation of entity2_term, most probably through direct interaction with the integrin, and induces cell spreading by its ARF-GEF activity

We tested this point by cotransfecting CHO cells with the genes encoding F beta alpha and the CG beta subunit or the CG beta alpha and FSH beta monomer The formation of a functional single chain/subunit complex was not restricted to the FSH single chain/CG beta subunit since CG single chain interacts with the monomeric FSH beta subunit and exhibits FSH activity This is relevant for the case of LH and FSH, because both are synthesized in the same cell (i.e., pituitary gonadotrophs) and several of the alpha subunit sequences required for association with either the entity1_term or entity2_term subunits are different Previously, we showed that the CG beta or FSH beta subunit genes can be genetically fused to the alpha gene to produce biologically active single chains, CG beta alpha and F beta alpha, respectively
