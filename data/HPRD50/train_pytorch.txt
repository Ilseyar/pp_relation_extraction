Here we demonstrate colocalization and direct interaction between CLIP-170 and LIS1 Overexpression of $T1$ results in a zinc finger-dependent localization of a $T2$ isoform and dynactin to MT bundles , raising the possibility that CLIP-170 and LIS1 regulate dynein/dynactin binding to MTs This work suggests that LIS1 is a regulated adapter between CLIP-170 and cytoplasmic dynein at sites involved in cargo-MT loading , and/or in the control of MT dynamics

Here we demonstrate colocalization and direct interaction between CLIP-170 and LIS1 Overexpression of CLIP-170 results in a zinc finger-dependent localization of a phospho-LIS1 isoform and dynactin to MT bundles , raising the possibility that CLIP-170 and LIS1 regulate dynein/dynactin binding to MTs This work suggests that $T1$ is a regulated adapter between $T2$ and cytoplasmic dynein at sites involved in cargo-MT loading , and/or in the control of MT dynamics

GC-GAP , a Rho family GTPase-activating protein that interacts with signaling adapters Gab1 and Gab2 Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2 , Shp-2 , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , Shc , and Crk In addition , GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs , and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length $T1$ in vitro We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli , acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein ( GAP ) for Rho family GTPases The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned $T2$ and displays activity toward RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 in vitro The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42 Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA

Differential binding of vascular cell-derived proteoglycans ( perlecan , biglycan , decorin , and versican ) to the beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer 's disease Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan , a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan , to the beta-amyloid protein ( A beta ) -containing amyloid deposits within the walls of blood vessels ( i.e. , congophilic angiopathy ) in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) brain Overall , the results indicate that specific vascular cell-derived PGs differentially interact with A beta , and that the interactions of highest affinity occur between A beta and binding sites on both the core protein and glycosaminoglycan chains of perlecan In the present investigation , the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell ( EC ) - and smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) -derived PGs to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits may be due to its interactions with perlecan Pretreatment of AA amyloidotic splenic and liver tissue sections with synthetic A beta ( 1-28 ) produced strong immunoreactivity with A beta antibodies at tissue sites enriched in perlecan which was partially removed by pretreatment with heparitinase , but not by chondroitin $T1$ lyase [ 35S ] -Sulfate labeled proteoglycans ( PGs ) derived from cultured ECs and SMCs bound to affinity columns containing A beta ( 1-28 ) or ( 1-40 ) , with virtually no binding to A beta ( 40-1 ) ( reverse peptide ) , beta-amyloid precursor protein ( 410-429 ) , or bovine serum albumin Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta ( 1-28 ) revealed strong binding by perlecan , weak binding by decorin and $T2$ , two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans , and lack of binding by versican/PG-M , a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
