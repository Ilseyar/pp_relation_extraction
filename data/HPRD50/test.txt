Cytohesin-1 regulates beta-2 integrin-mediated adhesion through both ARF-GEF function and interaction with LFA-1 Here we provide evidence of how cytohesin-1, an integrin-binding protein and guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF GTPases, regulates cell adhesion Mutational analyses of the beta-2 cytoplasmic domain revealed that the adhesive function of LFA-1 depends on its interaction with cytohesin-1, unless the integrin is activated by exogenous divalent cations Secondly, cytohesin-1 induces expression of an extracellular activation epitope of LFA-1, and the exchange factor function is not essential for this activity In contrast, LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 is strongly inhibited by a cytohesin-1 mutant, which fails to catalyze ARF GDP-GTP exchange in vitro Thus, entity1_term is involved in the activation of entity2_term, most probably through direct interaction with the integrin, and induces cell spreading by its ARF-GEF activity

We tested this point by cotransfecting CHO cells with the genes encoding F beta alpha and the CG beta subunit or the CG beta alpha and FSH beta monomer The formation of a functional single chain/subunit complex was not restricted to the FSH single chain/CG beta subunit since CG single chain interacts with the monomeric FSH beta subunit and exhibits FSH activity This is relevant for the case of LH and FSH, because both are synthesized in the same cell (i.e., pituitary gonadotrophs) and several of the alpha subunit sequences required for association with either the entity1_term or entity2_term subunits are different Previously, we showed that the CG beta or FSH beta subunit genes can be genetically fused to the alpha gene to produce biologically active single chains, CG beta alpha and F beta alpha, respectively
