$T1$ recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the $T2$ isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and $T1$, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', $T2$ exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene.

We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor ($T1$) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ($T2$ or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells.

In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of $T1$$T2$ mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl.

By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and $T1$ ligands, namely: $T2$ and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation.
