Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding $T1$$T2$) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that $T1$ is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two $T2$ elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human $T1$ ($T2$)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or $T1$ receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with $T2$. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and $T1$$T2$, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 ($T1$) as well as with the general transcription factor $T2$. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and $T1$ ligands, namely: SCF and $T2$, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Endogenous presenilin 1 redistributes to the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of Jurkat cells to a collagen matrix. Most familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease cases are caused by mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene. Subcellular localization of the endogenous PS1 is essential for understanding its function, interactions with proteins, and role in Alzheimer's disease. Although numerous studies revealed predominant localization of PS1 to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, there are conflicting reports on the localization of PS1 to the cell surface. We found that endogenous PS1 is highly expressed in T lymphocytes (Jurkat cells). Using a variety of methods, we present evidence that endogenous PS1 is localized to the cell surface in addition to intracellular membrane compartments. Moreover, PS1 appeared in high levels on the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of the cells to a collagen matrix. The redistribution of PS1 in adhered cells was strikingly similar to that of the well characterized adhesion protein CD44. Cell surface $T1$ formed complexes in vivo with actin-binding protein $T2$ (ABP-280), which is known to form bridges between cell surface receptors and cytoskeleton and mediate cell adhesion and cell motility. Taken together, our results suggest a role of PS1 in cell adhesion and/or cell-matrix interaction.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while $T1$$T2$-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous $T1$-binding properties: first, several mutated $T2$ proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and $T1$$T2$ IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. $T1$ is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-$T2$, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in $T1$ binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or $T2$) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

$T1$- and $T2$-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. $T1$ contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with $T2$. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Discrete protein interactions with the $T1$/$T2$ complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Enhanced degradation of EGF receptors by a sorting nexin, SNX1. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, sorting nexin-1 ($T1$), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the epidermal growth factor receptor ($T2$) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes.

JNK1: a protein kinase stimulated by UV light and Ha-Ras that binds and phosphorylates the c-Jun activation domain. The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by AP-1 and NF-kappa B. The effect on $T1$ transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the $T2$ NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and $T1$, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor ($T2$) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and $T1$$T2$) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and $T1$ $T2$ have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to $T1$$T2$ to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein.

In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2.

Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that $T1$ directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 ($T2$), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to $T1$. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and $T2$, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the $T1$ (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the $T2$ (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, $T1$-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-$T2$ complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 ($T1$) and IL-6 receptor ($T2$) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. $T1$ recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor ($T2$), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors ($T1$, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and $T2$ forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with $T1$ for binding to $T2$. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/$T1$$T2$ exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Endogenous presenilin 1 redistributes to the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of Jurkat cells to a collagen matrix. Most familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease cases are caused by mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene. Subcellular localization of the endogenous PS1 is essential for understanding its function, interactions with proteins, and role in Alzheimer's disease. Although numerous studies revealed predominant localization of PS1 to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, there are conflicting reports on the localization of PS1 to the cell surface. We found that endogenous PS1 is highly expressed in T lymphocytes (Jurkat cells). Using a variety of methods, we present evidence that endogenous PS1 is localized to the cell surface in addition to intracellular membrane compartments. Moreover, PS1 appeared in high levels on the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of the cells to a collagen matrix. The redistribution of PS1 in adhered cells was strikingly similar to that of the well characterized adhesion protein CD44. Cell surface PS1 formed complexes in vivo with actin-binding protein $T1$ ($T2$), which is known to form bridges between cell surface receptors and cytoskeleton and mediate cell adhesion and cell motility. Taken together, our results suggest a role of PS1 in cell adhesion and/or cell-matrix interaction.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin ($T1$) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding $T2$.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and $T1$, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the $T2$ gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2.

Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

JNK1: a protein kinase stimulated by UV light and Ha-Ras that binds and phosphorylates the c-Jun activation domain. The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by AP-1 and NF-kappa B. The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. $T1$ binds to the $T2$ transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein $T1$ constitutively binds a substantial fraction of $T2$ through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that $T1$ surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that $T2$ expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, $T1$ and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor ($T2$) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, $T1$-$T2$, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in $T1$$T2$ binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/$T1$$T2$) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the $T1$ bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide ($T2$), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 $T1$$T2$ IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and $T1$ have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to $T2$. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the $T1$ protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor ($T2$) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin ($T1$) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in $T2$ binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors $T1$/$T2$ and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-$T1$, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-$T2$ complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator $T1$ (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor $T2$. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some $T1$ substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or $T2$ in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link $T1$$T2$; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, $T1$ exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the $T2$ (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for $T1$$T2$ (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/$T1$$T2$/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the $T1$ and $T2$ molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that $T1$, $T2$, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for $T1$$T2$-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the $T1$$T2$ binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Crystal structure of the BMP-2-BRIA ectodomain complex. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals. Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II. Here we report the crystal structure of human dimeric BMP-2 in complex with two high affinity $T1$ extracellular domains($T2$). The receptor chains bind to the 'wrist' epitopes of the BMP-2 dimer and contact both BMP-2 monomers. No contacts exist between the receptor domains. The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor-ligand interactions that is seen in BMP-TGF-beta systems.

The splicing factor U2AF35 mediates critical protein-protein interactions in constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing. The splicing factor U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) is a heterodimer with subunits of 65 and 35 kD ($T1$ and $T2$). U2AF65 binds specifically to 3' splice sites, but previous studies failed to demonstrate a function for U2AF35. Here, we report that U2AF35 is required for constitutive splicing and also functions as a mediator of enhancer-dependent splicing. Nuclear extracts deficient in U2AF35 were inactive; however, both constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing could be restored by the addition of purified recombinant U2AF35. In vitro protein-RNA interaction studies with pre-mRNAs containing either a constitutive or regulated splicing enhancer revealed that U2AF35 directly mediates interactions between U2AF65 and proteins bound to the enhancers. Thus, U2AF35 functions as a bridge between U2AF65 and the enhancer complex to recruit U2AF65 to the adjacent intron.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between $T1$ and $T2$. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and $T1$$T2$ and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and $T1$ ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce $T2$ tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

14-3-3 proteins associate with cdc25 phosphatases. The cdc25 phosphatases play key roles in cell cycle progression by activating cyclin-dependent kinases. Two members of the 14-3-3 protein family have been isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify proteins that interact with the human cdc25A and cdc25B phosphatases. Genes encoding the human homolog of the 14-3-3 epsilon protein and the previously described 14-3-3 beta protein have been isolated in this screening. 14-3-3 proteins constitute a family of well-conserved eukaryotic proteins that were originally isolated in mammalian brain preparations and that possess diverse biochemical activities related to signal transduction. We present evidence that indicates that cdc25 and 14-3-3 proteins physically interact both in vitro and in vivo. 14-3-3 protein does not, however, affect the phosphatase activity of cdc25A. $T1$, which is known to bind 14-3-3 proteins, has recently been shown to associate with $T2$ and to stimulate its phosphatase activity. 14-3-3 protein, however, has no effect on the cdc25A-kinase activity of Raf-1. Instead, 14-3-3 may facilitate the association of cdc25 with Raf-1 in vivo, participating in the linkage between mitogenic signaling and the cell cycle machinery.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in $T1$, cyclin D1, $T2$, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of $T1$ with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is $T2$-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the $T1$$T2$, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with $T1$; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with $T2$ for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor ($T1$$T2$ receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', $T1$ exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an $T2$ (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than $T1$ directly inhibits $T2$-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of $T1$ in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including $T2$, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Discrete protein interactions with the $T1$/c-Cbl complex in $T2$- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor ($T1$$T2$ (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of $T1$ IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to $T2$. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing ($T1$) and calreticulin, and that $T2$ expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the $T1$ (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ($T2$ or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The $T1$/$T2$ family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and $T1$$T2$/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or $T1$ (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, $T2$, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of $T1$ by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and $T2$-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

JNK1: a protein kinase stimulated by UV light and Ha-Ras that binds and phosphorylates the c-Jun activation domain. The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by AP-1 and NF-kappa B. The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of $T1$, a distant relative of the $T2$ group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous $T1$-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to $T2$. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila $T1$, $T2$ interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the $T1$-activated $T2$. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 $T1$$T2$ were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, $T1$ and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the $T2$ gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator $T1$ ($T2$) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits $T1$$T2$/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the $T1$ (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding $T2$.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo. The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPmu on the surface of one cell binds to PTPmu on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that PTPmu associates with a complex containing cadherins, alpha- and beta-catenin in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of PTPmu binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to alpha- or beta-catenin. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including $T1$, the cadherins associated with PTPmu are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for $T2$. These data suggest that PTPmu may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of $T1$ by $T2$-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous $T1$-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with $T2$; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that $T1$$T2$. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of $T1$ IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while $T2$-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein ($T1$) and at least eight $T2$-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 $T1$ but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the $T2$ IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

B61 is a ligand for the $T1$$T2$ receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for ECK. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas $T1$ binds well to FGFR1, $T2$, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, $T1$ and $T2$, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor ($T1$), whereas FGF-2 binds well to $T2$, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by $T1$-$T2$, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that $T1$$T2$ exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto $T1$$T2$ binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and $T1$$T2$ and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/$T1$, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the $T2$ and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or $T1$ receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, $T2$, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of $T1$ residues that contact $T2$ in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

B61 is a ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain ($T1$$T2$ receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for ECK. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and $T1$, and that $T2$ immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Crystal structure of the BMP-2-BRIA ectodomain complex. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta ($T1$$T2$ (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals. Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II. Here we report the crystal structure of human dimeric BMP-2 in complex with two high affinity BMP receptor IA extracellular domains(BRIAec). The receptor chains bind to the 'wrist' epitopes of the BMP-2 dimer and contact both BMP-2 monomers. No contacts exist between the receptor domains. The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor-ligand interactions that is seen in BMP-TGF-beta systems.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated $T1$ proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to $T2$. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2.

Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor ($T1$) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ($T2$-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, $T1$ interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor $T2$. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and $T1$ but interacts poorly with $T2$. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and $T1$$T2$ exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto $T1$$T2$ and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

B61 is a ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of $T1$, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by $T2$. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for ECK. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with $T1$; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to $T2$. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and $T1$$T2$ and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and $T1$ receptor ($T2$) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Shared and unique determinants of the $T1$$T2$ are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, $T1$, and $T2$ but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by $T1$-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-$T2$ complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the $T1$ protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an $T2$ (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that $T1$ expression is $T2$-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, $T1$/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and $T2$ forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between $T1$ and $T2$. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-$T1$$T2$) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

We demonstrate that $T1$ surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to $T2$. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing $T1$ was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the $T2$ activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned $T1$ were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 $T2$. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor ($T1$$T2$ (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated $T1$ proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with $T2$; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by $T1$-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and $T2$-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

The $T1$ inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with $T2$. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable $T1$/$T2$ complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in $T1$ binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ($T2$-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Crystal structure of the BMP-2-BRIA ectodomain complex. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals. Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II. Here we report the crystal structure of human dimeric BMP-2 in complex with two high affinity $T1$$T2$s(BRIAec). The receptor chains bind to the 'wrist' epitopes of the BMP-2 dimer and contact both BMP-2 monomers. No contacts exist between the receptor domains. The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor-ligand interactions that is seen in BMP-TGF-beta systems.

CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and $T1$-$T2$ complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

14-3-3 proteins associate with cdc25 phosphatases. The cdc25 phosphatases play key roles in cell cycle progression by activating cyclin-dependent kinases. Two members of the 14-3-3 protein family have been isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify proteins that interact with the human cdc25A and cdc25B phosphatases. Genes encoding the human homolog of the 14-3-3 epsilon protein and the previously described 14-3-3 beta protein have been isolated in this screening. 14-3-3 proteins constitute a family of well-conserved eukaryotic proteins that were originally isolated in mammalian brain preparations and that possess diverse biochemical activities related to signal transduction. We present evidence that indicates that cdc25 and 14-3-3 proteins physically interact both in vitro and in vivo. 14-3-3 protein does not, however, affect the phosphatase activity of cdc25A. Raf-1, which is known to bind 14-3-3 proteins, has recently been shown to associate with cdc25A and to stimulate its phosphatase activity. 14-3-3 protein, however, has no effect on the $T1$-kinase activity of $T2$. Instead, 14-3-3 may facilitate the association of cdc25 with Raf-1 in vivo, participating in the linkage between mitogenic signaling and the cell cycle machinery.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor ($T1$$T2$ isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition.

Crystal structure of the BMP-2-BRIA ectodomain complex. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals. Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II. Here we report the crystal structure of human dimeric $T1$ in complex with two high affinity $T2$ extracellular domains(BRIAec). The receptor chains bind to the 'wrist' epitopes of the BMP-2 dimer and contact both BMP-2 monomers. No contacts exist between the receptor domains. The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor-ligand interactions that is seen in BMP-TGF-beta systems.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the $T1$$T2$ enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that $T1$ surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing ($T2$) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which $T1$ regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the $T2$ gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the $T1$$T2$ complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 ($T1$) and $T2$ (IL-6R) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding $T1$$T2$ (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo. The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPmu on the surface of one cell binds to PTPmu on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that $T1$ associates with a complex containing $T2$- and beta-catenin in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of PTPmu binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to alpha- or beta-catenin. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including PTPmu, the cadherins associated with PTPmu are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTPmu. These data suggest that PTPmu may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and $T1$, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an $T2$ (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and $T1$ have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with $T2$ for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

JNK1: a protein kinase stimulated by UV light and Ha-Ras that binds and phosphorylates the $T1$$T2$ that binds and phosphorylates the c-Jun activation domain. The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by AP-1 and NF-kappa B. The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. $T1$ is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, $T2$-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both $T1$ and $T2$ ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. $T1$ is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and $T2$-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to $T1$$T2$ isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in $T1$ binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ($T2$ or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto $T1$$T2$.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor $T1$ consists of $T2$ (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

B61 is a ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of $T1$ in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for $T2$. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between $T1$ (IL-6) and $T2$ (IL-6R) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including $T1$, -2, -4, and -6, while $T2$ IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor ($T1$$T2$ exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation.

In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/$T1$ complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase ($T2$) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the $T1$ ($T2$-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 $T1$$T2$ and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of $T1$ for $T2$ and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between $T1$ ($T2$) and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein $T1$$T2$ complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). $T1$ encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, $T2$, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein ($T1$$T2$ consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin ($T1$) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ($T2$-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed $T1$$T2$, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an $T1$/$T2$ complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or $T1$$T2$ (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the $T1$ (TAP) and calreticulin, and that $T2$ expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. $T1$ is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by $T2$-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of $T1$ IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including $T2$, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, $T1$/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the $T2$ and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated $T1$$T2$ complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, $T1$ and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', $T2$ exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) $T1$ specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF ($T2$) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, $T1$$T2$ IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein.

In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2.

Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

B61 is a ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain ($T1$$T2$ has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for ECK. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by $T1$-Cdk2, cyclin E-$T2$, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with $T1$/$T2$ complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/$T1$, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and $T2$ forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, $T1$ and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an $T2$ (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the $T1$ IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 $T2$. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Crystal structure of the BMP-2-BRIA ectodomain complex. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals. Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II. Here we report the crystal structure of human dimeric BMP-2 in complex with two high affinity BMP receptor IA extracellular domains(BRIAec). The receptor chains bind to the 'wrist' epitopes of the $T1$ dimer and contact both $T2$ monomers. No contacts exist between the receptor domains. The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor-ligand interactions that is seen in BMP-TGF-beta systems.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight $T1$$T2$ (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for $T1$$T2$ binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that $T1$ associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing ($T2$) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase $T1$ associates with $T2$, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. $T1$ recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and $T2$ but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

B61 is a ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant $T1$ induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for $T2$. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and $T1$$T2$ immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, $T1$$T2$ enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo. The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPmu on the surface of one cell binds to PTPmu on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that PTPmu associates with a complex containing $T1$- and $T2$ in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of PTPmu binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to alpha- or beta-catenin. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including PTPmu, the cadherins associated with PTPmu are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTPmu. These data suggest that PTPmu may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) $T1$ specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor $T2$ (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas $T1$$T2$ isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of $T1$ to activate $T2$, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous $T1$-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with $T2$ for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, $T1$-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-$T2$ complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

JNK1: a protein kinase stimulated by UV light and Ha-Ras that binds and phosphorylates the c-Jun activation domain. The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by AP-1 and NF-kappa B. The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, $T1$ partially activates $T2$ and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the $T1$ (EPO-binding protein or $T2$) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells.

The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors ($T1$, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the $T2$ and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that $T1$$T2$ with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and $T1$/$T2$ alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or $T1$ (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with $T2$. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin ($T1$) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the $T2$ (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the $T1$$T2$/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two $T1$-containing complexes; $T2$. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2.

Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. $T1$ is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-$T2$, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that $T1$ represses $T2$ mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Endogenous presenilin 1 redistributes to the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of Jurkat cells to a collagen matrix. Most familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease cases are caused by mutations in the presenilin 1 ($T1$$T2$ (PS1) gene. Subcellular localization of the endogenous PS1 is essential for understanding its function, interactions with proteins, and role in Alzheimer's disease. Although numerous studies revealed predominant localization of PS1 to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, there are conflicting reports on the localization of PS1 to the cell surface. We found that endogenous PS1 is highly expressed in T lymphocytes (Jurkat cells). Using a variety of methods, we present evidence that endogenous PS1 is localized to the cell surface in addition to intracellular membrane compartments. Moreover, PS1 appeared in high levels on the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of the cells to a collagen matrix. The redistribution of PS1 in adhered cells was strikingly similar to that of the well characterized adhesion protein CD44. Cell surface PS1 formed complexes in vivo with actin-binding protein filamin (ABP-280), which is known to form bridges between cell surface receptors and cytoskeleton and mediate cell adhesion and cell motility. Taken together, our results suggest a role of PS1 in cell adhesion and/or cell-matrix interaction.

B61 is a ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant $T1$ induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with $T2$ being an authentic ligand for ECK. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/$T1$, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and $T2$ forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Crystal structure of the BMP-2-BRIA ectodomain complex. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals. Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II. Here we report the crystal structure of human dimeric BMP-2 in complex with two high affinity $T1$s($T2$). The receptor chains bind to the 'wrist' epitopes of the BMP-2 dimer and contact both BMP-2 monomers. No contacts exist between the receptor domains. The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor-ligand interactions that is seen in BMP-TGF-beta systems.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of $T1$ contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for $T2$ recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the $T1$ (TAP) and $T2$, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and $T1$$T2$ (IL-6R) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via $T1$$T2$ complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-$T1$, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and $T2$-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ($T1$$T2$ or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila $T1$, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor $T2$. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and $T1$$T2$ is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Enhanced degradation of EGF receptors by a sorting nexin, SNX1. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, $T1$ (SNX1), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the epidermal growth factor receptor ($T2$) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, $T1$ IIIb and $T2$, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-6 receptor ($T1$) is the initial and most specific step in the $T2$ signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both $T1$ and $T2$, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the $T1$ SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated $T2$. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the $T1$ ($T2$) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Endogenous presenilin 1 redistributes to the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of Jurkat cells to a collagen matrix. Most familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease cases are caused by mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene. Subcellular localization of the endogenous PS1 is essential for understanding its function, interactions with proteins, and role in Alzheimer's disease. Although numerous studies revealed predominant localization of PS1 to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, there are conflicting reports on the localization of PS1 to the cell surface. We found that endogenous PS1 is highly expressed in T lymphocytes (Jurkat cells). Using a variety of methods, we present evidence that endogenous PS1 is localized to the cell surface in addition to intracellular membrane compartments. Moreover, PS1 appeared in high levels on the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of the cells to a collagen matrix. The redistribution of PS1 in adhered cells was strikingly similar to that of the well characterized adhesion protein CD44. Cell surface $T1$ formed complexes in vivo with actin-binding protein filamin ($T2$), which is known to form bridges between cell surface receptors and cytoskeleton and mediate cell adhesion and cell motility. Taken together, our results suggest a role of PS1 in cell adhesion and/or cell-matrix interaction.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the $T1$$T2$/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human $T1$ reveals interactions with VP16 and $T2$ that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

B61 is a ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the $T1$$T2$ has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for ECK. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and $T1$$T2$ IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that $T1$ directly interacts with $T2$ (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in $T1$$T2$ and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the $T1$ (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or $T2$) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that $T1$ associates with the $T2$ (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-$T1$, cyclin D1-$T2$, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or $T1$$T2$ recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

JNK1: a protein kinase stimulated by UV light and Ha-Ras that binds and phosphorylates the c-Jun activation domain. The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by $T1$ and $T2$. The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and $T1$$T2$ and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

$T1$: a protein kinase stimulated by UV light and Ha-Ras that binds and phosphorylates the $T2$ activation domain. The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by AP-1 and NF-kappa B. The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2.

Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated $T1$ proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with $T2$ for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and $T1$$T2$ (IL-6) and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo. The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPmu on the surface of one cell binds to PTPmu on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that PTPmu associates with a complex containing cadherins, alpha- and beta-catenin in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of PTPmu binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to alpha- or beta-catenin. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including $T1$, the cadherins associated with $T2$ are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTPmu. These data suggest that PTPmu may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-$T1$, cyclin E-$T2$, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with $T1$$T2$ plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

14-3-3 proteins associate with cdc25 phosphatases. The cdc25 phosphatases play key roles in cell cycle progression by activating cyclin-dependent kinases. Two members of the 14-3-3 protein family have been isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify proteins that interact with the human cdc25A and cdc25B phosphatases. Genes encoding the human homolog of the 14-3-3 epsilon protein and the previously described 14-3-3 beta protein have been isolated in this screening. 14-3-3 proteins constitute a family of well-conserved eukaryotic proteins that were originally isolated in mammalian brain preparations and that possess diverse biochemical activities related to signal transduction. We present evidence that indicates that cdc25 and 14-3-3 proteins physically interact both in vitro and in vivo. 14-3-3 protein does not, however, affect the phosphatase activity of cdc25A. Raf-1, which is known to bind 14-3-3 proteins, has recently been shown to associate with cdc25A and to stimulate its phosphatase activity. 14-3-3 protein, however, has no effect on the cdc25A-kinase activity of Raf-1. Instead, 14-3-3 may facilitate the association of $T1$ with $T2$ in vivo, participating in the linkage between mitogenic signaling and the cell cycle machinery.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin ($T1$) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ($T2$ or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

B61 is a ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for ECK. $T1$ is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to $T2$, and can be isolated in the same way.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2.

Enhanced degradation of EGF receptors by a sorting nexin, SNX1. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, $T1$ (SNX1), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the $T2$ (EGFR) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to $T1$, $T2$, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent $T1$$T2$-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Endogenous presenilin 1 redistributes to the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of Jurkat cells to a collagen matrix. Most familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease cases are caused by mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene. Subcellular localization of the endogenous PS1 is essential for understanding its function, interactions with proteins, and role in Alzheimer's disease. Although numerous studies revealed predominant localization of PS1 to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, there are conflicting reports on the localization of $T1$$T2$ to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, there are conflicting reports on the localization of PS1 to the cell surface. We found that endogenous PS1 is highly expressed in T lymphocytes (Jurkat cells). Using a variety of methods, we present evidence that endogenous PS1 is localized to the cell surface in addition to intracellular membrane compartments. Moreover, PS1 appeared in high levels on the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of the cells to a collagen matrix. The redistribution of PS1 in adhered cells was strikingly similar to that of the well characterized adhesion protein CD44. Cell surface PS1 formed complexes in vivo with actin-binding protein filamin (ABP-280), which is known to form bridges between cell surface receptors and cytoskeleton and mediate cell adhesion and cell motility. Taken together, our results suggest a role of PS1 in cell adhesion and/or cell-matrix interaction.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of $T1$ IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while $T2$ IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by $T1$-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, $T2$-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of $T1$ and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase ($T2$) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 ($T1$) and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is the initial and most specific step in the $T2$ signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these $T1$$T2$. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, $T1$ blocks the ability of $T2$ to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained $T1$ like affinity for FGFR1 and for $T2$. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and $T1$$T2$ and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the $T1$$T2$ is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, $T1$ also links to $T2$. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of $T1$ by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, $T2$-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing ($T1$) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is $T2$-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding $T1$.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ($T2$ or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, $T1$$T2$ recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/$T1$, and TRAFs) associated with both of the $T2$ and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human $T1$ reveals interactions with $T2$ and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo. The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPmu on the surface of one cell binds to PTPmu on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that PTPmu associates with a complex containing cadherins, alpha- and beta-catenin in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of PTPmu binds directly to the intracellular domain of $T1$, but not to alpha- or $T2$. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including PTPmu, the cadherins associated with PTPmu are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTPmu. These data suggest that PTPmu may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits $T1$, probably via $T2$. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human $T1$ ($T2$) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the $T1$$T2$. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, $T1$ signaling pathway utilizes two $T2$-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind $T1$$T2$ dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-$T1$ immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/$T2$ and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in $T1$, $T2$, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the $T1$ protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', $T2$ exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that $T1$ surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is $T2$-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo. The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPmu on the surface of one cell binds to PTPmu on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that PTPmu associates with a complex containing cadherins, alpha- and beta-catenin in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of $T1$ binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to alpha- or $T2$. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including PTPmu, the cadherins associated with PTPmu are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTPmu. These data suggest that PTPmu may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila $T1$, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 ($T2$) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the $T1$ bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for $T2$ binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that $T1$ associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and $T2$, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned $T1$ were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the $T2$ IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and $T1$$T2$ and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.

Analysis of the human interleukin-6/human interleukin-6 receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 ($T1$)/$T2$ binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor ($T1$), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and $T2$ but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

$T1$: a protein kinase stimulated by UV light and $T2$ that binds and phosphorylates the c-Jun activation domain. The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by AP-1 and NF-kappa B. The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, $T1$ interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator $T2$ (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing ($T1$) and $T2$, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the $T1$ (EPOR) is crucial for binding $T2$.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, $T1$, $T2$, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both $T1$ and c-Kit ligands, namely: $T2$ and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of $T1$ upon ligand binding resulted in activation of $T2$ pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein.

In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2.

Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that $T1$ transactivation requires the interactions of both $T2$ and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and $T1$ have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with $T2$; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human TFIID reveals interactions with VP16 and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation. Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant $T1$ complex containing $T2$ was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

Analysis of the human $T1$/human $T2$ receptor binding interface at the amino acid level: proposed mechanism of interaction. The interaction between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is the initial and most specific step in the IL-6 signaling pathway. Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small IL-6-inhibiting molecules. We studied the human IL-6 (hIL-6)/hIL-6R binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding-free energy. These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition. Following this hypothesis, we altered in hIL-6 and hIL-6R residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other. We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an IL-6/IL-6R complex and their ability to transduce the signal. This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue-clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions, suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation. The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis. Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha-subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved.

Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated $T1$ was not able to induce dissociation of $T2$. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

TAP- and tapasin-dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide. BACKGROUND: The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class lb molecule HLA-E is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell. We have recently shown that HLA-E binds signal-sequence-derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro. RESULTS: Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA-E, we show that HLA-E is expressed at the cell surface. We demonstrate that HLA-E surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to HLA-E. Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and $T1$$T2$ with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent. In addition, HLA-E dissociates from TAP upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides. CONCLUSION: These experiments establish that surface expression of HLA-E is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules. The correlation between HLA-E and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of HLA-E. Our results also show that, although these HLA-E binding peptides are derived from signal sequences, they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the TAP complex and loaded onto HLA-E molecules.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the $T1$ subunit, $T2$. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide. We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the $T1$ ($T2$ or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while $T1$-expressing cells responded only to $T2$. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras.

The p21 Cdk-interacting protein Cip1 is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-$T1$, and cyclin D2-$T2$ complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.

Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. $T1$ recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the $T2$ isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and $T1$, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', $T2$ exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Discrete protein interactions with the Grb2/c-Cbl complex in SCF- and TPO-mediated myeloid cell proliferation. Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non-tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the Grb2/c-Cbl. In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/c-Cbl complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase (c-Kit) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation. By using the growth factor dependent M-07e cell line, we found that both c-Mpl and c-Kit ligands, namely: SCF and TPO, induce c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. In these cells the adaptor protein Grb2 constitutively binds a substantial fraction of c-Cbl through the N-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro experiments showed that the stable Grb2/c-Cbl complex interacts, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, with the SCF-activated c-Kit. By contrast stimulation with TPO leads to the formation of a Grb2 complex containing JAK2. In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that Grb2 mediates the association of $T1$$T2$ mediates the association of c-Kit with c-Cbl. Moreover we found that, upon SCF stimulation, the Grb2/c-Cbl complex recruits Shc, probably via Grb2. By contrast the Ras exchanger factor (Sos1) was not detected in anti-c-Cbl immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes. Taken together our results demonstrate that c-Cbl plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with Grb2/c-Cbl complex when non-tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated.
