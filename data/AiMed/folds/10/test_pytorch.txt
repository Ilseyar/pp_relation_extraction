BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity $T1$ binding was detected spanning the interface of the $T2$ dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, EBP) of the $T1$$T2$, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin ($T1$$T2$) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs ($T1$), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a $T2$ from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to BMPR-II. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products $T1$, v-Fos, and $T2$, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the $T1$ receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded $T2$. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as $T1$$T2$ (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Cdi1, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with Cdk2. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, $T1$ interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human Cdc2, Cdk2, and Cdk3, but not with $T2$. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including Grb2, Crk and PI3 kinase, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that $T1$ is a negative regulator of the $T2$. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving c-Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of $T1$ to Raf/330; however, the $T2$-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Cloning and expression of human TAFII250: a TBP-associated factor implicated in cell-cycle regulation. Basal transcription by human RNA polymerase II requires the coordinate action of several ancillary factors (TFIIA-J) and can be regulated by various promoter-specific DNA binding proteins. An additional class of factors, called coactivators, are dispensable for basal transcription but are indispensable for regulation by transcriptional activators. Biochemical studies established that some coactivators are associated with the $T1$ (TBP) to form the $T2$ complex. We therefore set out to define the relationship between TBP and these TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we describe the cloning, expression and properties of the first human TAF, hTAFII250. The hTAFII250 gene is identical to a gene, CCG1, (ref 7,8), implicated in cell-cycle progression. Recombinant hTAFII250 binds directly to TBP both in vitro and in yeast, and participates in the formation of the TFIID complex. This largest TAF may therefore play a central role in TFIID assembly by interacting with both TBP and other TAFs, as well as serving to link the control of transcription to the cell cycle.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor $T1$ is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein $T2$ ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

The Cockayne syndrome group A gene encodes a WD repeat protein that interacts with CSB protein and a subunit of RNA polymerase II TFIIH. The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype. CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/$T1$$T2$ gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/Snf. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. CSA protein interacts with CSB protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH. These observations suggest that the products of the CSA and CSB genes are involved in transcription.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. $T1$ (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, $T2$, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding $T1$ of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal $T2$-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, tonin, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

$T1$$T2$: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the $T1$ (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for $T2$ activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or $T1$ (type II) were characterized using $T2$ mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after $T1$$T2$ associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

The Cockayne syndrome group A gene encodes a WD repeat protein that interacts with CSB protein and a subunit of RNA polymerase II TFIIH. The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype. CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/Snf. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. CSA protein interacts with CSB protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH. These observations suggest that the products of the $T1$ and $T2$ genes are involved in transcription.

Interaction of the protein nucleobindin with G alpha i2, as revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system. The heterotrimeric G protein, G alpha i2, transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with G alpha i2 by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length G alpha i2. Four positive colonies were obtained. Two of the four were identified as nucleobindin, a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti-nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus. Nucleobindin has a leucine zipper, EF hands, and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted. The specificity of intehraction between G alpha i2 and nucleobindin was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. Transfection of $T1$ and nucleobindin in COS cells increased $T2$ expression relative to cells transfected with G alpha i2 and mock vector. Our results indicate that the yeast two-hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G alpha proteins. Nucleobindin appears to represent one of those proteins.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, $T1$/BMP-7, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to $T2$. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to $T1$; however, the $T2$-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing $T1$ or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, $T2$ rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Characterization of $T1$ (Apo-1, $T2$)-Fas ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. $T1$, $T2$, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Cdi1, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with Cdk2. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, Cdi1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human $T1$, $T2$, and Cdk3, but not with Cdk4. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including Grb2, Crk and PI3 kinase, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that $T1$ is a negative regulator of the $T2$ receptor. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving c-Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

$T1$ negatively regulates $T2$ activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by $T1$ in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/$T2$.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, $T1$$T2$, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, $T1$$T2$, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of $T1$ and $T2$ transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Multiple proteins physically interact with PU.1. Transcriptional synergy with NF-IL6 beta (C/$T1$$T2$ (C/EBP delta, CRP3). PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 disrupted PU.1-NF-IL6 beta physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.

Presenilins interact with Rab11, a small GTPase involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. Presenilin 1 ($T1$$T2$ (PS1) mutations account for the majority of early-onset dominant cases of familial Alzheimer's disease. Presenilins (PSs) are located in many intra-cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, nuclear region and vesicular structures. These proteins include from seven to nine putative transmembrane domains, with the N- and C-terminal ends and a large hydrophilic loop orientated towards the cytoplasm. We report an interaction between the human PS1 or PS2 hydrophilic loop and Rab11, a small GTPase belonging to the Ras-related superfamily. Interaction domains were mapped to codons 374-400 for PS1 and to codons 106-179 for Rab11, a region including the fourth GTP-binding domain. Considering the implication of Rab proteins in vesicular transport pathways, the PS-Rab11 inter-action suggests that PSs might be involved in amyloid precursor protein vesicular routing.

Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of $T1$ to $T2$; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity.

Functional participation of the IL-2 receptor gamma chain in IL-7 receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional $T1$$T2$ and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. $T1$ specifically interacts with $T2$ but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated $T1$ ($T2$), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. $T1$ is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the $T2$ gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, $T1$ serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and $T2$ effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Functional participation of the IL-2 receptor gamma chain in IL-7 receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the $T1$$T2$ (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional IL-4 receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between $T1$$T2$ revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and $T1$ genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for $T2$) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

Association of terminal complement proteins in solution and modulation by suramin. The association of terminal complement proteins was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation and multi-angle laser light scattering. Native C8 and C9 formed a heterodimer in solution of physiological ionic strength with a free-energy change DeltaG degrees of -8.3 kcal/mol and a dissociation constant Kd of 0.6 microM (at 20 degrees C) that was ionic strength- and temperature-dependent. A van't Hoff plot of the change in Kd was linear between 10 and 37 degrees C and yielded values of DeltaH degrees = -12.9 kcal/mol and DeltaS degrees = -15.9 cal mol-1 deg-1, suggesting that electrostatic forces play a prominent role in the interaction of C8 with C9. Native C8 also formed a heterodimer with C5,and low concentrations of polyionic ligands such as protamine and suramin inhibited the interaction. Suramin induced high-affinity trimerization of C8 (Kd = 0.10 microM at 20 degrees C) and dimerization of C9 (Kd = 0.86 microM at 20 degrees C). Suramin-induced C8 oligomerization may be the primary reason for the drug's ability to prevent complement-mediated hemolysis. Analysis of sedimentation equilibria and also of the fluorescence enhancement of suramin when bound to protein provided evidence for two suramin-binding sites on each $T1$ and three on each $T2$ in the oligomers. Oligomerization could be reversed by high suramin concentrations, but 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6- trisulfonate (ANTS2- ), which mimics half a suramin molecule, could not compete with suramin binding and oligomerization suggesting that the drug also binds nonionically to the proteins.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and $T1$ have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates $T2$ signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, $T1$$T2$, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Interaction of transthyretin with amyloid beta-protein: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. Transthyretin (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of $T1$$T2$ (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that A beta binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of A beta aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein $T1$ complexed with $T2$. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both $T1$ and $T2$ may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

Crystal structure of the heterodimeric bZIP transcription factor $T1$-$T2$ bound to DNA. The Fos and Jun families of eukaryotic transcription factors heterodimerize to form complexes capable of binding 5'-TGAGTCA-3' DNA elements. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of a heterodimer of the bZIP regions of c-Fos and c-Jun bound to DNA. Both subunits form continuous alpha-helices. The carboxy-terminal regions form an asymmetric coiled-coil, and the amino-terminal regions make base-specific contacts with DNA in the major groove. Comparison of the two crystallographically distinct protein-DNA complexes show that the coiled-coil is flexibly joined to the basic regions and that the Fos-Jun heterodimer does not recognize the asymmetric 5'-TGAGTCA-3' recognition element in a unique orientation. There is an extensive network of electrostatic interactions between subunits within the coiled-coil, consistent with proposals that these interactions determine preferential formation of the heterodimer over either of the homodimers.

The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for $T1$ and 195 kDa for $T2$) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes $T1$$T2$ signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Efficient interaction of HIV-1 with purified dendritic cells via multiple chemokine coreceptors. HIV-1 actively replicates in dendritic cell (DC)-T cell cocultures, but it has been difficult to demonstrate substantial infection of purified mature DCs. We now find that HIV-1 begins reverse transcription much more efficiently in DCs than T cells, even though T cells have higher levels of CD4 and gp120 binding. DCs isolated from skin or from blood precursors behave similarly. Several M-tropic strains and the T-tropic strain IIIB enter DCs efficiently, as assessed by the progressive formation of the early products of reverse transcription after a 90-min virus pulse at 37 degrees C. However, few late gag-containing sequences are detected, so that active viral replication does not occur. The formation of these early transcripts seems to follow entry of HIV-1, rather than binding of virions that contain viral DNA. Early transcripts are scarce if DCs are exposed to virus on ice for 4 h, or for 90 min at 37 degrees C, conditions which allow virus binding. Also the early transcripts once formed are insensitive to trypsin. The entry of a M-tropic isolates is blocked by the chemokine RANTES, and the entry of IIIB by SDF-1. $T1$ interacts with CCR5 and SDF-1 with $T2$ receptors. Entry of M-tropic but not T-tropic virus is ablated in DCs from individuals who lack a functional CCR5 receptor. DCs express more CCR5 and CXCR4 mRNA than T cells. Therefore, while HIV-1 does not replicate efficiently in mature DCs, viral entry can be active and can be blocked by chemokines that act on known receptors for M- and T-tropic virus.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator $T1$ ($T2$). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and $T1$$T2$ and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, CD95)-$T1$$T2$ interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of $T1$$T2$ function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, EBP) of the $T1$$T2$ binding protein, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

Physical interaction of mammalian $T1$ with CDK4 $T2$ was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

Cdi1, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with Cdk2. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, Cdi1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human $T1$, Cdk2, and $T2$, but not with Cdk4. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as $T1$$T2$ (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and $T1$$T2$ and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Interaction of the protein nucleobindin with G alpha i2, as revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system. The heterotrimeric G protein, G alpha i2, transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with G alpha i2 by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length G alpha i2. Four positive colonies were obtained. Two of the four were identified as nucleobindin, a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti-nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus. Nucleobindin has a leucine zipper, EF hands, and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted. The specificity of intehraction between G alpha i2 and nucleobindin was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. Transfection of G alpha i2 and $T1$ in COS cells increased $T2$ expression relative to cells transfected with G alpha i2 and mock vector. Our results indicate that the yeast two-hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G alpha proteins. Nucleobindin appears to represent one of those proteins.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein $T1$$T2$ (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous $T1$ led to a decrease in $T2$-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase ($T1$) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the $T2$-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the $T1$ ($T2$), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to $T1$, $T2$ rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases $T1$, $T2$, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Characterization of $T1$ ($T2$, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the $T1$, calmodulin ($T2$). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products $T1$, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with $T2$ products.

Interaction of transthyretin with amyloid beta-protein: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. Transthyretin (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of $T1$$T2$), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that A beta binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of A beta aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit ($T1$$T2$ (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the $T1$ is also critical for $T2$ interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Molecular cloning and expression of a receptor for human tumor necrosis factor. A human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binding protein from serum of cancer patients was purified to homogeneity and partially sequenced. Synthetic DNA probes based on amino acid sequence information were used to isolate cDNA clones encoding a receptor for TNF. The TNF receptor (TNF-R) is a 415 amino acid polypeptide with a single membrane-spanning region. The extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the TNF-R is homologous to the nerve growth factor receptor and the B cell activation protein Bp50. Human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a TNF-R expression vector specifically bind both 125I-labeled and biotinylated TNF-alpha. Unlabeled TNF-alpha and TNF-beta were equally effective at displacing the binding of labeled $T1$$T2$ and TNF-beta were equally effective at displacing the binding of labeled TNF-alpha to TNF-R expressing cells. Northern analysis indicates a single species of mRNA for the TNF-R in a variety of cell types. Therefore, the soluble TNF binding protein found in human serum is probably proteolytically derived from the TNF-R.

Interaction of transthyretin with amyloid beta-protein: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. Transthyretin (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with $T1$ and significantly decreased the rate of $T2$ fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that A beta binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of A beta aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, $T1$, or with $T2$. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or $T1$$T2$, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or $T1$$T2$ (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor $T1$ is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein $T2$ (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both $T1$ and $T2$. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of $T1$$T2$ is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with $T1$$T2$ receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

Functional participation of the IL-2 receptor gamma chain in IL-7 receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the $T1$ is shared with the functional $T2$ and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

Cdi1, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with Cdk2. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, Cdi1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human Cdc2, $T1$, and $T2$, but not with Cdk4. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, $T1$$T2$ (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding RAS of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with $T1$, tonin, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and $T2$. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of $T1$, complement factors C3 and C4, and $T2$ may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of $T1$$T2$ proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

Multiple proteins physically interact with PU.1. Transcriptional synergy with NF-IL6 beta (C/EBP delta, CRP3). PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 disrupted PU.1-NF-IL6 beta physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and $T1$$T2$ and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the $T1$ cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for $T2$ activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

Analysis of the oligomerization of $T1$ and $T2$ products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to BMPR-II. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of $T1$/BMP-7 to $T2$ was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.

Interaction of transthyretin with amyloid beta-protein: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. Transthyretin (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that $T1$ binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of $T2$ aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both $T1$ and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and $T2$.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated $T1$-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of $T2$ expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine ($T1$) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and $T2$. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the $T1$ homotrimer bound to three $T2$ molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of $T1$$T2$-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the $T1$$T2$ is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including $T1$, $T2$ and PI3 kinase, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving c-Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

A direct interaction between $T1$ subunits and the $T2$. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding RAS of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, $T1$, D and $T2$ and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin ($T1$), and complement factors C3 and $T2$ can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Expression cloning of a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Two cDNA clones encoding a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF-R) were isolated by expression screening of a library made from human placental mRNA. Pools of recombinant plasmid DNA were electroporated into COS cells which were then screened for their capacity to bind radioiodinated hGM-CSF using a sensitive microscopic autoradiographic approach. The cloned GM-CSF-R precursor is a 400 amino acid polypeptide (Mr 45,000) with a single transmembrane domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain and a short (54 amino acids) intracytoplasmic tail. It does not contain a tyrosine kinase domain nor show homology with members of the immunoglobulin super gene family, but does show some significant sequence homologies with receptors for several other haemopoietic growth factors, including those for interleukin-6, erythropoietin and $T1$$T2$, erythropoietin and interleukin-2 (beta-chain) and also to the prolactin receptor. When transfected into COS cells the cloned cDNA directed the expression of a GM-CSF-R showing a single class of affinity (KD = 2(-8) nM) and specificity for human GM-CSF but not interleukin-3. Messenger RNA coding for this receptor was detected in a variety of haemopoietic cells known to display hGM-CSF binding, and cross-linking experiments revealed a similar size for the glycosylated receptors in transfected COS and haemopoietic cells.

Interaction of transthyretin with amyloid beta-protein: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of $T1$ with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of $T2$ only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. Transthyretin (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that A beta binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of A beta aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

Multiple proteins physically interact with PU.1. Transcriptional synergy with NF-IL6 beta (C/EBP delta, CRP3). PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, $T1$$T2$, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 disrupted PU.1-NF-IL6 beta physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.

A lymphotoxin-beta-specific receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha ($T1$$T2$ (LT-alpha) are members of a family of secreted and cell surface cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The cell surface form of LT-alpha is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta), a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family. Secreted LT-alpha is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface LT-alpha-LT-beta complex. A receptor specific for human LT-beta was identified, which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted LT-alpha.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and $T1$$T2$ and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily.

Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to $T1$$T2$), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to BMPR-II. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of $T1$$T2$ to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Crystal structure of the heterodimeric bZIP transcription factor c-Fos-c-Jun bound to DNA. The $T1$ and $T2$ families of eukaryotic transcription factors heterodimerize to form complexes capable of binding 5'-TGAGTCA-3' DNA elements. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of a heterodimer of the bZIP regions of c-Fos and c-Jun bound to DNA. Both subunits form continuous alpha-helices. The carboxy-terminal regions form an asymmetric coiled-coil, and the amino-terminal regions make base-specific contacts with DNA in the major groove. Comparison of the two crystallographically distinct protein-DNA complexes show that the coiled-coil is flexibly joined to the basic regions and that the Fos-Jun heterodimer does not recognize the asymmetric 5'-TGAGTCA-3' recognition element in a unique orientation. There is an extensive network of electrostatic interactions between subunits within the coiled-coil, consistent with proposals that these interactions determine preferential formation of the heterodimer over either of the homodimers.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of $T1$ alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with $T2$. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of $T1$ to phosphotyrosines on both $T2$ and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, $T1$) of the $T2$. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of $T1$ and $T2$ were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between $T1$ and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on $T2$. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding RAS of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, $T1$$T2$, tonin, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Characterization of Fas ($T1$, CD95)-$T2$ ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated $T1$$T2$ (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of $T1$$T2$ and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

Expression cloning of a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Two cDNA clones encoding a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF-R) were isolated by expression screening of a library made from human placental mRNA. Pools of recombinant plasmid DNA were electroporated into COS cells which were then screened for their capacity to bind radioiodinated hGM-CSF using a sensitive microscopic autoradiographic approach. The cloned GM-CSF-R precursor is a 400 amino acid polypeptide (Mr 45,000) with a single transmembrane domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain and a short (54 amino acids) intracytoplasmic tail. It does not contain a tyrosine kinase domain nor show homology with members of the immunoglobulin super gene family, but does show some significant sequence homologies with receptors for several other haemopoietic growth factors, including those for interleukin-6, erythropoietin and interleukin-2 (beta-chain) and also to the prolactin receptor. When transfected into COS cells the cloned cDNA directed the expression of a GM-CSF-R showing a single class of affinity (KD = 2(-8) nM) and specificity for human $T1$ but not $T2$. Messenger RNA coding for this receptor was detected in a variety of haemopoietic cells known to display hGM-CSF binding, and cross-linking experiments revealed a similar size for the glycosylated receptors in transfected COS and haemopoietic cells.

BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of $T1$ for $T2$ (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of $T1$ (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and $T2$ can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the $T1$ receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin ($T2$) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

$T1$, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with $T2$. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, Cdi1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human Cdc2, Cdk2, and Cdk3, but not with Cdk4. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, $T1$$T2$ specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

Molecular cloning and expression of a receptor for human tumor necrosis factor. A human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binding protein from serum of cancer patients was purified to homogeneity and partially sequenced. Synthetic DNA probes based on amino acid sequence information were used to isolate cDNA clones encoding a receptor for TNF. The TNF receptor (TNF-R) is a 415 amino acid polypeptide with a single membrane-spanning region. The extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the TNF-R is homologous to the nerve growth factor receptor and the $T1$ $T2$. Human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a TNF-R expression vector specifically bind both 125I-labeled and biotinylated TNF-alpha. Unlabeled TNF-alpha and TNF-beta were equally effective at displacing the binding of labeled TNF-alpha to TNF-R expressing cells. Northern analysis indicates a single species of mRNA for the TNF-R in a variety of cell types. Therefore, the soluble TNF binding protein found in human serum is probably proteolytically derived from the TNF-R.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in $T1$, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of $T2$ with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and $T1$$T2$, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the $T1$ receptor ($T2$), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of $T1$ and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus $T2$ protein.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, $T1$ serum, $T2$-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, $T1$, Fra2, $T2$, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified $T1$ subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of $T2$ (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as $T1$$T2$) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Interaction of transthyretin with amyloid beta-protein: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. Transthyretin (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, $T1$ exclusively decreased the level of $T2$ pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that A beta binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of A beta aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 $T1$ was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of $T2$ with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding RAS of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, tonin, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating $T1$ of renal origin and the extrarenal $T2$ specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound $T1$ more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with $T2$. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and less efficiently $T1$, bound to $T2$. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein $T1$ ligand ($T2$). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK ($T1$$T2$ (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Multiple proteins physically interact with PU.1. Transcriptional synergy with NF-IL6 beta (C/EBP delta, CRP3). PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 disrupted PU.1-NF-IL6 beta physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that $T1$ and $T2$ can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the $T1$$T2$, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Mutagenesis studies of the human $T1$$T2$. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and $T1$$T2$, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including Grb2, Crk and PI3 kinase, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving $T1$ and two 14-3-3 isoforms, $T2$, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of $T1$ alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between $T2$ chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of $T1$$T2$ may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding $T1$ of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, tonin, D and $T2$ and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/$T1$, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to $T2$. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of $T1$$T2$ complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, $T1$, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with $T2$ using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated $T1$ (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of $T2$, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and $T1$, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with $T2$ products.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 $T1$$T2$ .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

Multiple proteins physically interact with PU.1. Transcriptional synergy with NF-IL6 beta (C/EBP delta, CRP3). PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of $T1$ disrupted $T2$-NF-IL6 beta physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.

A lymphotoxin-beta-specific receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha) are members of a family of secreted and cell surface cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The cell surface form of LT-alpha is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta), a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family. Secreted LT-alpha is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface $T1$-$T2$ complex. A receptor specific for human LT-beta was identified, which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted LT-alpha.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets $T1$ and $T2$, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Cloning and expression of human TAFII250: a TBP-associated factor implicated in cell-cycle regulation. Basal transcription by human RNA polymerase II requires the coordinate action of several ancillary factors (TFIIA-J) and can be regulated by various promoter-specific DNA binding proteins. An additional class of factors, called coactivators, are dispensable for basal transcription but are indispensable for regulation by transcriptional activators. Biochemical studies established that some coactivators are associated with the $T1$ ($T2$) to form the TFIID complex. We therefore set out to define the relationship between TBP and these TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we describe the cloning, expression and properties of the first human TAF, hTAFII250. The hTAFII250 gene is identical to a gene, CCG1, (ref 7,8), implicated in cell-cycle progression. Recombinant hTAFII250 binds directly to TBP both in vitro and in yeast, and participates in the formation of the TFIID complex. This largest TAF may therefore play a central role in TFIID assembly by interacting with both TBP and other TAFs, as well as serving to link the control of transcription to the cell cycle.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on $T1$$T2$ complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of $T1$ (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, $T2$ and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of $T1$$T2$ may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Interaction of transthyretin with amyloid beta-protein: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. $T1$ ($T2$), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that A beta binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of A beta aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of $T1$ are required for efficient interaction with $T2$. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to BMPR-II. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by $T1$/$T2$.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as $T1$, $T2$, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

A lymphotoxin-beta-specific receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha) are members of a family of secreted and cell surface cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The cell surface form of LT-alpha is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta), a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family. Secreted LT-alpha is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface LT-alpha-LT-beta complex. A receptor specific for human $T1$ was identified, which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted $T2$.

$T1$-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor $T2$. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between $T1$ and $T2$ suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both $T1$ and $T2$ have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble $T1$ (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each $T2$ monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

Multiple proteins physically interact with PU.1. Transcriptional synergy with NF-IL6 beta (C/EBP delta, CRP3). PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between $T1$ and $T2$, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 disrupted PU.1-NF-IL6 beta physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of $T1$ (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, $T2$ (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the $T1$$T2$ (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

Efficient interaction of HIV-1 with purified dendritic cells via multiple chemokine coreceptors. HIV-1 actively replicates in dendritic cell (DC)-T cell cocultures, but it has been difficult to demonstrate substantial infection of purified mature DCs. We now find that HIV-1 begins reverse transcription much more efficiently in DCs than T cells, even though T cells have higher levels of CD4 and gp120 binding. DCs isolated from skin or from blood precursors behave similarly. Several M-tropic strains and the T-tropic strain IIIB enter DCs efficiently, as assessed by the progressive formation of the early products of reverse transcription after a 90-min virus pulse at 37 degrees C. However, few late gag-containing sequences are detected, so that active viral replication does not occur. The formation of these early transcripts seems to follow entry of HIV-1, rather than binding of virions that contain viral DNA. Early transcripts are scarce if DCs are exposed to virus on ice for 4 h, or for 90 min at 37 degrees C, conditions which allow virus binding. Also the early transcripts once formed are insensitive to trypsin. The entry of a M-tropic isolates is blocked by the chemokine RANTES, and the entry of IIIB by SDF-1. RANTES interacts with $T1$ and $T2$ with CXCR4 receptors. Entry of M-tropic but not T-tropic virus is ablated in DCs from individuals who lack a functional CCR5 receptor. DCs express more CCR5 and CXCR4 mRNA than T cells. Therefore, while HIV-1 does not replicate efficiently in mature DCs, viral entry can be active and can be blocked by chemokines that act on known receptors for M- and T-tropic virus.

In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and $T1$$T2$ and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Efficient interaction of HIV-1 with purified dendritic cells via multiple chemokine coreceptors. HIV-1 actively replicates in dendritic cell (DC)-T cell cocultures, but it has been difficult to demonstrate substantial infection of purified mature DCs. We now find that HIV-1 begins reverse transcription much more efficiently in DCs than T cells, even though T cells have higher levels of CD4 and gp120 binding. DCs isolated from skin or from blood precursors behave similarly. Several M-tropic strains and the T-tropic strain IIIB enter DCs efficiently, as assessed by the progressive formation of the early products of reverse transcription after a 90-min virus pulse at 37 degrees C. However, few late gag-containing sequences are detected, so that active viral replication does not occur. The formation of these early transcripts seems to follow entry of HIV-1, rather than binding of virions that contain viral DNA. Early transcripts are scarce if DCs are exposed to virus on ice for 4 h, or for 90 min at 37 degrees C, conditions which allow virus binding. Also the early transcripts once formed are insensitive to trypsin. The entry of a M-tropic isolates is blocked by the chemokine RANTES, and the entry of IIIB by SDF-1. RANTES interacts with $T1$ and SDF-1 with $T2$ receptors. Entry of M-tropic but not T-tropic virus is ablated in DCs from individuals who lack a functional CCR5 receptor. DCs express more CCR5 and CXCR4 mRNA than T cells. Therefore, while HIV-1 does not replicate efficiently in mature DCs, viral entry can be active and can be blocked by chemokines that act on known receptors for M- and T-tropic virus.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the $T1$ and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for $T2$) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of $T1$ with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of $T2$ and HSP90.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of $T1$, complement factors C3 and $T2$, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the $T1$ helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the $T2$ dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. $T1$ and $T2$ have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which $T1$ promotes $T2$ activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of $T1$ in the $T2$ cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including Grb2, $T1$ and $T2$, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving c-Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

A lymphotoxin-beta-specific receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha) are members of a family of secreted and cell surface cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The cell surface form of LT-alpha is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin-beta ($T1$$T2$ (LT-beta), a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family. Secreted LT-alpha is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface LT-alpha-LT-beta complex. A receptor specific for human LT-beta was identified, which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted LT-alpha.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a $T1$ ($T2$) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, $T1$, FosB, or with $T2$. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

Cloning and expression of human TAFII250: a TBP-associated factor implicated in cell-cycle regulation. Basal transcription by human RNA polymerase II requires the coordinate action of several ancillary factors (TFIIA-J) and can be regulated by various promoter-specific DNA binding proteins. An additional class of factors, called coactivators, are dispensable for basal transcription but are indispensable for regulation by transcriptional activators. Biochemical studies established that some coactivators are associated with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form the TFIID complex. We therefore set out to define the relationship between TBP and these TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we describe the cloning, expression and properties of the first human TAF, hTAFII250. The hTAFII250 gene is identical to a gene, CCG1, (ref 7,8), implicated in cell-cycle progression. Recombinant $T1$ binds directly to $T2$ both in vitro and in yeast, and participates in the formation of the TFIID complex. This largest TAF may therefore play a central role in TFIID assembly by interacting with both TBP and other TAFs, as well as serving to link the control of transcription to the cell cycle.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, $T1$)-$T2$ interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

$T1$ negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the $T2$ cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that $T1$ may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on $T2$. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and $T1$ in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus $T2$ protein.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to $T1$, $T2$ forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and $T1$ have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor ($T2$). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the $T1$$T2$ (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the $T1$$T2$ restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including Grb2, Crk and PI3 kinase, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of $T1$ in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the $T2$. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving c-Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the $T1$ receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to $T2$ (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, $T1$$T2$, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the $T1$$T2$ is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Cloning and expression of human TAFII250: a TBP-associated factor implicated in cell-cycle regulation. Basal transcription by human RNA polymerase II requires the coordinate action of several ancillary factors (TFIIA-J) and can be regulated by various promoter-specific DNA binding proteins. An additional class of factors, called coactivators, are dispensable for basal transcription but are indispensable for regulation by transcriptional activators. Biochemical studies established that some coactivators are associated with the TATA-binding protein ($T1$) to form the $T2$ complex. We therefore set out to define the relationship between TBP and these TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we describe the cloning, expression and properties of the first human TAF, hTAFII250. The hTAFII250 gene is identical to a gene, CCG1, (ref 7,8), implicated in cell-cycle progression. Recombinant hTAFII250 binds directly to TBP both in vitro and in yeast, and participates in the formation of the TFIID complex. This largest TAF may therefore play a central role in TFIID assembly by interacting with both TBP and other TAFs, as well as serving to link the control of transcription to the cell cycle.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding RAS of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, tonin, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating $T1$ of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue $T2$, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and $T1$$T2$ and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, $T1$, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with $T2$ products.

Efficient interaction of HIV-1 with purified dendritic cells via multiple chemokine coreceptors. HIV-1 actively replicates in dendritic cell (DC)-T cell cocultures, but it has been difficult to demonstrate substantial infection of purified mature DCs. We now find that HIV-1 begins reverse transcription much more efficiently in DCs than T cells, even though T cells have higher levels of $T1$ and $T2$ binding. DCs isolated from skin or from blood precursors behave similarly. Several M-tropic strains and the T-tropic strain IIIB enter DCs efficiently, as assessed by the progressive formation of the early products of reverse transcription after a 90-min virus pulse at 37 degrees C. However, few late gag-containing sequences are detected, so that active viral replication does not occur. The formation of these early transcripts seems to follow entry of HIV-1, rather than binding of virions that contain viral DNA. Early transcripts are scarce if DCs are exposed to virus on ice for 4 h, or for 90 min at 37 degrees C, conditions which allow virus binding. Also the early transcripts once formed are insensitive to trypsin. The entry of a M-tropic isolates is blocked by the chemokine RANTES, and the entry of IIIB by SDF-1. RANTES interacts with CCR5 and SDF-1 with CXCR4 receptors. Entry of M-tropic but not T-tropic virus is ablated in DCs from individuals who lack a functional CCR5 receptor. DCs express more CCR5 and CXCR4 mRNA than T cells. Therefore, while HIV-1 does not replicate efficiently in mature DCs, viral entry can be active and can be blocked by chemokines that act on known receptors for M- and T-tropic virus.

Cdi1, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with Cdk2. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, Cdi1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human $T1$, Cdk2, and Cdk3, but not with $T2$. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between $T1$ and the two targets $T2$ and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which $T1$$T2$ signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Cdi1, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with Cdk2. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, $T1$ interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human Cdc2, $T2$, and Cdk3, but not with Cdk4. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to $T1$$T2$ (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, $T1$, $T2$, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding RAS of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, tonin, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal $T1$ specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two $T2$ components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Interaction of the protein nucleobindin with G alpha i2, as revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system. The heterotrimeric G protein, G alpha i2, transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with G alpha i2 by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length G alpha i2. Four positive colonies were obtained. Two of the four were identified as nucleobindin, a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti-nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus. Nucleobindin has a leucine zipper, EF hands, and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted. The specificity of intehraction between G alpha i2 and nucleobindin was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. Transfection of G alpha i2 and $T1$ in COS cells increased G alpha i2 expression relative to cells transfected with $T2$ and mock vector. Our results indicate that the yeast two-hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G alpha proteins. Nucleobindin appears to represent one of those proteins.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, $T1$ ($T2$). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of $T1$ with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian $T2$. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

Functional participation of the IL-2 receptor gamma chain in IL-7 receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the $T1$ (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional $T2$ and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between $T1$ and $T2$ revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

A lymphotoxin-beta-specific receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha) are members of a family of secreted and cell surface cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The cell surface form of LT-alpha is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta), a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family. Secreted $T1$ is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface $T2$-LT-beta complex. A receptor specific for human LT-beta was identified, which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted LT-alpha.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, $T1$$T2$, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

Presenilins interact with Rab11, a small GTPase involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. Presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations account for the majority of early-onset dominant cases of familial Alzheimer's disease. Presenilins (PSs) are located in many intra-cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, nuclear region and vesicular structures. These proteins include from seven to nine putative transmembrane domains, with the N- and C-terminal ends and a large hydrophilic loop orientated towards the cytoplasm. We report an interaction between the human $T1$ or $T2$ hydrophilic loop and Rab11, a small GTPase belonging to the Ras-related superfamily. Interaction domains were mapped to codons 374-400 for PS1 and to codons 106-179 for Rab11, a region including the fourth GTP-binding domain. Considering the implication of Rab proteins in vesicular transport pathways, the PS-Rab11 inter-action suggests that PSs might be involved in amyloid precursor protein vesicular routing.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing $T1$ or HeLa cells were exposed to $T2$, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, $T1$, Fra2, FosB, or with $T2$. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using $T1$$T2$ for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

A lymphotoxin-beta-specific receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha) are members of a family of secreted and cell surface cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The cell surface form of $T1$ is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin-beta ($T2$), a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family. Secreted LT-alpha is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface LT-alpha-LT-beta complex. A receptor specific for human LT-beta was identified, which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted LT-alpha.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, $T1$, and complement factors C3 and $T2$ concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged $T1$$T2$ and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin ($T1$$T2$) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

Expression cloning of a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Two cDNA clones encoding a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF-R) were isolated by expression screening of a library made from human placental mRNA. Pools of recombinant plasmid DNA were electroporated into COS cells which were then screened for their capacity to bind radioiodinated hGM-CSF using a sensitive microscopic autoradiographic approach. The cloned GM-CSF-R precursor is a 400 amino acid polypeptide (Mr 45,000) with a single transmembrane domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain and a short (54 amino acids) intracytoplasmic tail. It does not contain a tyrosine kinase domain nor show homology with members of the immunoglobulin super gene family, but does show some significant sequence homologies with receptors for several other haemopoietic growth factors, including those for interleukin-6, erythropoietin and interleukin-2 (beta-chain) and also to the prolactin receptor. When transfected into COS cells the cloned cDNA directed the expression of a $T1$ showing a single class of affinity (KD = 2(-8) nM) and specificity for human GM-CSF but not $T2$. Messenger RNA coding for this receptor was detected in a variety of haemopoietic cells known to display hGM-CSF binding, and cross-linking experiments revealed a similar size for the glycosylated receptors in transfected COS and haemopoietic cells.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/$T1$, and less efficiently $T2$, bound to BMPR-II. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. $T1$ induced maximal migration of $T2$ and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Functional participation of the IL-2 receptor gamma chain in IL-7 receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the interleukin-2 ($T1$) receptor is shared with the functional $T2$ and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding RAS of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, tonin, D and $T1$$T2$, tonin, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Cloning and expression of human TAFII250: a TBP-associated factor implicated in cell-cycle regulation. Basal transcription by human RNA polymerase II requires the coordinate action of several ancillary factors (TFIIA-J) and can be regulated by various promoter-specific DNA binding proteins. An additional class of factors, called coactivators, are dispensable for basal transcription but are indispensable for regulation by transcriptional activators. Biochemical studies established that some coactivators are associated with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form the TFIID complex. We therefore set out to define the relationship between TBP and these TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we describe the cloning, expression and properties of the first human TAF, hTAFII250. The hTAFII250 gene is identical to a gene, CCG1, (ref 7,8), implicated in cell-cycle progression. Recombinant hTAFII250 binds directly to TBP both in vitro and in yeast, and participates in the formation of the TFIID complex. This largest TAF may therefore play a central role in $T1$ assembly by interacting with both $T2$ and other TAFs, as well as serving to link the control of transcription to the cell cycle.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that $T1$ interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain ($T2$, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Multiple proteins physically interact with PU.1. Transcriptional synergy with NF-IL6 beta (C/EBP delta, CRP3). PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, HMG I/Y, and $T1$$T2$, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 disrupted PU.1-NF-IL6 beta physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, $T1$, was found to efficiently interact with $T2$. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of $T1$$T2$: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of $T1$ proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including Grb2, $T2$ and PI3 kinase, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving c-Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. $T1$ ($T2$, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

The Cockayne syndrome group A gene encodes a WD repeat protein that interacts with CSB protein and a subunit of RNA polymerase II TFIIH. The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype. CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast $T1$$T2$ gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/Snf. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. CSA protein interacts with CSB protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH. These observations suggest that the products of the CSA and CSB genes are involved in transcription.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as $T1$ binding protein, $T2$) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. $T1$ (neuromodulin, $T2$, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Functional participation of the IL-2 receptor gamma chain in $T1$$T2$ receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional IL-4 receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between $T1$$T2$ and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of $T1$$T2$ complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between $T1$ and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of $T2$ to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of $T1$ for BMPR-IA (type I) and $T2$ or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. $T1$ induced maximal migration of CCR1 and $T2$ transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by $T1$$T2$ but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Expression cloning of a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Two cDNA clones encoding a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF-R) were isolated by expression screening of a library made from human placental mRNA. Pools of recombinant plasmid DNA were electroporated into COS cells which were then screened for their capacity to bind radioiodinated hGM-CSF using a sensitive microscopic autoradiographic approach. The cloned GM-CSF-R precursor is a 400 amino acid polypeptide (Mr 45,000) with a single transmembrane domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain and a short (54 amino acids) intracytoplasmic tail. It does not contain a tyrosine kinase domain nor show homology with members of the immunoglobulin super gene family, but does show some significant sequence homologies with receptors for several other haemopoietic growth factors, including those for interleukin-6, erythropoietin and $T1$$T2$ and interleukin-2 (beta-chain) and also to the prolactin receptor. When transfected into COS cells the cloned cDNA directed the expression of a GM-CSF-R showing a single class of affinity (KD = 2(-8) nM) and specificity for human GM-CSF but not interleukin-3. Messenger RNA coding for this receptor was detected in a variety of haemopoietic cells known to display hGM-CSF binding, and cross-linking experiments revealed a similar size for the glycosylated receptors in transfected COS and haemopoietic cells.

Cdi1, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with Cdk2. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, Cdi1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human Cdc2, Cdk2, and $T1$, but not with $T2$. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of $T1$ shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a $T2$ homolog in Drosophila.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of $T1$$T2$ function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin ($T1$$T2$ (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit ($T1$), as well as $T2$ (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. $T1$ and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by $T2$ (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding $T1$ of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, $T2$, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and $T1$-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant $T2$ but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

A lymphotoxin-beta-specific receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha) are members of a family of secreted and cell surface cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The cell surface form of LT-alpha is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta), a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family. Secreted $T1$ is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface LT-alpha-$T2$ complex. A receptor specific for human LT-beta was identified, which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted LT-alpha.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to $T1$; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, $T2$ and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that $T1$ binds directly to the isolated $T2$. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and $T1$ have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by $T2$ (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and $T1$$T2$ (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

Characterization of $T1$ (Apo-1, CD95)-$T2$ ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK ($T1$$T2$ (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Molecular cloning and expression of a receptor for human tumor necrosis factor. A human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binding protein from serum of cancer patients was purified to homogeneity and partially sequenced. Synthetic DNA probes based on amino acid sequence information were used to isolate cDNA clones encoding a receptor for TNF. The TNF receptor (TNF-R) is a 415 amino acid polypeptide with a single membrane-spanning region. The extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the TNF-R is homologous to the nerve growth factor receptor and the B cell activation protein Bp50. Human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a TNF-R expression vector specifically bind both 125I-labeled and biotinylated TNF-alpha. Unlabeled $T1$ and $T2$ were equally effective at displacing the binding of labeled TNF-alpha to TNF-R expressing cells. Northern analysis indicates a single species of mRNA for the TNF-R in a variety of cell types. Therefore, the soluble TNF binding protein found in human serum is probably proteolytically derived from the TNF-R.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and $T1$$T2$ gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The $T1$ gene product, $T2$, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with $T1$ differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between $T2$ chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of $T1$$T2$ was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of $T1$ (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the $T2$-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after $T1$$T2$, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as $T1$$T2$, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including Grb2, Crk and PI3 kinase, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving $T1$ and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, $T2$. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, $T1$ ($T2$), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Functional participation of the $T1$ receptor gamma chain in $T2$ receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional IL-4 receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein ($T1$), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of $T2$, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Multiple proteins physically interact with PU.1. Transcriptional synergy with NF-IL6 beta (C/EBP delta, CRP3). PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, $T1$, and $T2$), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 disrupted PU.1-NF-IL6 beta physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with $T1$$T2$ but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that USF and Fra1 physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors $T1$ and $T2$ can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Functional participation of the IL-2 receptor gamma chain in IL-7 receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the $T1$ is shared with the functional $T2$ receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of $T1$ to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, $T2$ and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to BMPR-II. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by $T1$ in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by $T2$/BMP-7.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and $T1$$T2$ and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding RAS of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, tonin, D and $T1$$T2$-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, tonin, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Crystal structure of the heterodimeric bZIP transcription factor c-Fos-c-Jun bound to DNA. The Fos and Jun families of eukaryotic transcription factors heterodimerize to form complexes capable of binding 5'-TGAGTCA-3' DNA elements. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of a heterodimer of the bZIP regions of c-Fos and c-Jun bound to DNA. Both subunits form continuous alpha-helices. The carboxy-terminal regions form an asymmetric coiled-coil, and the amino-terminal regions make base-specific contacts with DNA in the major groove. Comparison of the two crystallographically distinct protein-DNA complexes show that the coiled-coil is flexibly joined to the basic regions and that the $T1$-$T2$ heterodimer does not recognize the asymmetric 5'-TGAGTCA-3' recognition element in a unique orientation. There is an extensive network of electrostatic interactions between subunits within the coiled-coil, consistent with proposals that these interactions determine preferential formation of the heterodimer over either of the homodimers.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit ($T1$$T2$ catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on $T1$$T2$-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate $T1$ and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, $T2$. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. $T1$ (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and $T2$. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 ($T1$, $T2$, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of $T1$ proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including $T2$, Crk and PI3 kinase, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving c-Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, $T1$ initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator $T2$ (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and $T1$ may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and $T2$.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the $T1$ and $T2$ genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and $T1$ (or $T2$) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as $T1$$T2$ catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and $T1$$T2$ and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Functional participation of the IL-2 receptor gamma chain in IL-7 receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the interleukin-2 ($T1$$T2$ (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional IL-4 receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to BMPR-II. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of $T1$/$T2$ to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the $T1$ ($T2$, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Characterization of $T1$ (Apo-1, CD95)-$T2$ interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the $T1$ and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of $T2$ to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Physical interaction of mammalian $T1$ with CDK4 .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of $T2$ with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. $T1$ ($T2$) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

Multiple proteins physically interact with PU.1. Transcriptional synergy with NF-IL6 beta (C/$T1$, $T2$). PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 disrupted PU.1-NF-IL6 beta physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding $T1$ of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, tonin, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and $T2$. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

$T1$: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor $T2$. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

The Cockayne syndrome group A gene encodes a WD repeat protein that interacts with CSB protein and a subunit of RNA polymerase II TFIIH. The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype. CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator $T1$$T2$ gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/Snf. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. CSA protein interacts with CSB protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH. These observations suggest that the products of the CSA and CSB genes are involved in transcription.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, $T1$, NCC-4, and $T2$. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase ($T1$) blocked the binding of $T2$ to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the $T1$ and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for $T2$ and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin ($T1$), and complement factors $T2$ and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001).

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding RAS of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, $T1$, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and $T2$. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the $T1$ ($T2$) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of $T1$ proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including Grb2, Crk and $T2$, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving c-Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and $T1$$T2$ revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Physical interaction of mammalian $T1$ with $T2$ .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit ($T1$), as well as protein phosphatase 1 ($T2$) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

A lymphotoxin-beta-specific receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha) are members of a family of secreted and cell surface cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The cell surface form of $T1$ is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with $T2$ (LT-beta), a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family. Secreted LT-alpha is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface LT-alpha-LT-beta complex. A receptor specific for human LT-beta was identified, which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted LT-alpha.

Functional participation of the IL-2 receptor gamma chain in IL-7 receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional IL-4 receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the $T1$ receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for $T2$ that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the $T1$$T2$ binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the $T1$$T2$ (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of $T1$$T2$ required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and less efficiently $T1$$T2$/BMP-7, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to BMPR-II. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both $T1$ and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates $T2$ signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related $T1$-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three $T2$ molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the $T1$$T2$ and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, $T1$, and complement factors $T2$ and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

The Cockayne syndrome group A gene encodes a WD repeat protein that interacts with CSB protein and a subunit of RNA polymerase II TFIIH. The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype. CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator $T1$$T2$ protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/Snf. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. CSA protein interacts with CSB protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH. These observations suggest that the products of the CSA and CSB genes are involved in transcription.

Cloning and expression of human TAFII250: a TBP-associated factor implicated in cell-cycle regulation. Basal transcription by human RNA polymerase II requires the coordinate action of several ancillary factors (TFIIA-J) and can be regulated by various promoter-specific DNA binding proteins. An additional class of factors, called coactivators, are dispensable for basal transcription but are indispensable for regulation by transcriptional activators. Biochemical studies established that some coactivators are associated with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form the TFIID complex. We therefore set out to define the relationship between TBP and these TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we describe the cloning, expression and properties of the first human TAF, hTAFII250. The hTAFII250 gene is identical to a gene, CCG1, (ref 7,8), implicated in cell-cycle progression. Recombinant hTAFII250 binds directly to $T1$ both in vitro and in yeast, and participates in the formation of the $T2$ complex. This largest TAF may therefore play a central role in TFIID assembly by interacting with both TBP and other TAFs, as well as serving to link the control of transcription to the cell cycle.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding RAS of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with isorenin, tonin, D and $T1$ and ending with the conversion enzyme and $T2$. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was $T1$ effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and $T2$ effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with $T1$ .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of $T2$ with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.

Mutagenesis studies of the human erythropoietin receptor. Establishment of structure-function relationships. Mutagenesis of the $T1$ ($T2$) permits analysis of the contribution that individual amino acid residues make to erythropoietin (EPO) binding. We employed both random and site-specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain (referred to as EPO binding protein, EBP) of the EPOR. Residues were chosen for site-specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Site-specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EBP and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. In addition, selected mutant proteins were expressed as full-length EPOR on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I-EPO binding in receptor binding assays. Using these methods, we have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. We present correlations between these mutagenesis data and the recently solved crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand.

BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of $T1$ for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or $T2$ (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.

Molecular cloning and expression of a receptor for human tumor necrosis factor. A human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binding protein from serum of cancer patients was purified to homogeneity and partially sequenced. Synthetic DNA probes based on amino acid sequence information were used to isolate cDNA clones encoding a receptor for TNF. The TNF receptor (TNF-R) is a 415 amino acid polypeptide with a single membrane-spanning region. The extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the TNF-R is homologous to the nerve growth factor receptor and the B cell activation protein Bp50. Human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a TNF-R expression vector specifically bind both 125I-labeled and biotinylated TNF-alpha. Unlabeled TNF-alpha and TNF-beta were equally effective at displacing the binding of labeled $T1$$T2$ were equally effective at displacing the binding of labeled TNF-alpha to TNF-R expressing cells. Northern analysis indicates a single species of mRNA for the TNF-R in a variety of cell types. Therefore, the soluble TNF binding protein found in human serum is probably proteolytically derived from the TNF-R.

Efficient interaction of HIV-1 with purified dendritic cells via multiple chemokine coreceptors. HIV-1 actively replicates in dendritic cell (DC)-T cell cocultures, but it has been difficult to demonstrate substantial infection of purified mature DCs. We now find that HIV-1 begins reverse transcription much more efficiently in DCs than T cells, even though T cells have higher levels of CD4 and gp120 binding. DCs isolated from skin or from blood precursors behave similarly. Several M-tropic strains and the T-tropic strain IIIB enter DCs efficiently, as assessed by the progressive formation of the early products of reverse transcription after a 90-min virus pulse at 37 degrees C. However, few late gag-containing sequences are detected, so that active viral replication does not occur. The formation of these early transcripts seems to follow entry of HIV-1, rather than binding of virions that contain viral DNA. Early transcripts are scarce if DCs are exposed to virus on ice for 4 h, or for 90 min at 37 degrees C, conditions which allow virus binding. Also the early transcripts once formed are insensitive to trypsin. The entry of a M-tropic isolates is blocked by the chemokine RANTES, and the entry of IIIB by SDF-1. RANTES interacts with CCR5 and $T1$$T2$ interacts with CCR5 and SDF-1 with CXCR4 receptors. Entry of M-tropic but not T-tropic virus is ablated in DCs from individuals who lack a functional CCR5 receptor. DCs express more CCR5 and CXCR4 mRNA than T cells. Therefore, while HIV-1 does not replicate efficiently in mature DCs, viral entry can be active and can be blocked by chemokines that act on known receptors for M- and T-tropic virus.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that $T1$ interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for $T2$ activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. $T1$ and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor ($T2$). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and $T1$$T2$ and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-$T1$ complex, a molecular model of the $T2$ homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of $T1$ ($T2$). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, $T1$, and $T2$. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including Grb2, Crk and PI3 kinase, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the $T1$$T2$. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving c-Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

The Cockayne syndrome group A gene encodes a WD repeat protein that interacts with CSB protein and a subunit of RNA polymerase II TFIIH. The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype. CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator $T1$/$T2$. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. CSA protein interacts with CSB protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH. These observations suggest that the products of the CSA and CSB genes are involved in transcription.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and $T1$$T2$ and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of $T1$ and TfR shows two $T2$ molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing $T1$ or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the $T2$ complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the $T1$, $T2$ (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

HFE binds to the transferrin receptor ($T1$), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded $T2$. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase ($T1$) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to $T2$; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Functional participation of the IL-2 receptor gamma chain in IL-7 receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the $T1$ (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional $T2$ receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

Expression cloning of a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Two cDNA clones encoding a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF-R) were isolated by expression screening of a library made from human placental mRNA. Pools of recombinant plasmid DNA were electroporated into COS cells which were then screened for their capacity to bind radioiodinated hGM-CSF using a sensitive microscopic autoradiographic approach. The cloned GM-CSF-R precursor is a 400 amino acid polypeptide (Mr 45,000) with a single transmembrane domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain and a short (54 amino acids) intracytoplasmic tail. It does not contain a tyrosine kinase domain nor show homology with members of the immunoglobulin super gene family, but does show some significant sequence homologies with receptors for several other haemopoietic growth factors, including those for interleukin-6, erythropoietin and interleukin-2 (beta-chain) and also to the prolactin receptor. When transfected into COS cells the cloned cDNA directed the expression of a $T1$ showing a single class of affinity (KD = 2(-8) nM) and specificity for human $T2$ but not interleukin-3. Messenger RNA coding for this receptor was detected in a variety of haemopoietic cells known to display hGM-CSF binding, and cross-linking experiments revealed a similar size for the glycosylated receptors in transfected COS and haemopoietic cells.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as $T1$ ($T2$) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. $T1$, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and $T2$ concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was alpha1AT effusion, C4 serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products $T1$, $T2$, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the insulin receptor and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between $T1$ and the two targets IRS-1 and $T2$. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. $T1$ ($T2$) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and $T1$ genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for $T2$ and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of $T1$ alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact $T2$, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Association of terminal complement proteins in solution and modulation by suramin. The association of terminal complement proteins was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation and multi-angle laser light scattering. Native C8 and C9 formed a heterodimer in solution of physiological ionic strength with a free-energy change DeltaG degrees of -8.3 kcal/mol and a dissociation constant Kd of 0.6 microM (at 20 degrees C) that was ionic strength- and temperature-dependent. A van't Hoff plot of the change in Kd was linear between 10 and 37 degrees C and yielded values of DeltaH degrees = -12.9 kcal/mol and DeltaS degrees = -15.9 cal mol-1 deg-1, suggesting that electrostatic forces play a prominent role in the interaction of C8 with C9. Native C8 also formed a heterodimer with C5,and low concentrations of polyionic ligands such as protamine and suramin inhibited the interaction. Suramin induced high-affinity trimerization of $T1$ (Kd = 0.10 microM at 20 degrees C) and dimerization of $T2$ (Kd = 0.86 microM at 20 degrees C). Suramin-induced C8 oligomerization may be the primary reason for the drug's ability to prevent complement-mediated hemolysis. Analysis of sedimentation equilibria and also of the fluorescence enhancement of suramin when bound to protein provided evidence for two suramin-binding sites on each C9 and three on each C8 in the oligomers. Oligomerization could be reversed by high suramin concentrations, but 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6- trisulfonate (ANTS2- ), which mimics half a suramin molecule, could not compete with suramin binding and oligomerization suggesting that the drug also binds nonionically to the proteins.

Cross-family interaction between the bHLHZip USF and bZip Fra1 proteins results in down-regulation of AP1 activity. Heterodimerization among the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins or among the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors. To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein, USF, we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with USF using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bZip protein, Fra1, was found to efficiently interact with USF. USF specifically interacts with Fra1 but not with other closely related family members, c-Fos, Fra2, FosB, or with c-Jun. Both the bHLHZip and the N-terminal regions of Fra1 are required for efficient interaction with USF. In vivo association between USF and Fra1 has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of exogenous USF led to a decrease in AP1-dependent transcription in F9 cells. Co-expression of exogenous Fra1 restored the AP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. These data show that $T1$ and $T2$ physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross-talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families.

Multiple proteins physically interact with PU.1. Transcriptional synergy with NF-IL6 beta (C/EBP delta, CRP3). PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 disrupted $T1$-$T2$ physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the $T1$ and how this interaction may mediate $T2$ function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Characterization of Fas ($T1$, CD95)-$T2$ interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

Cdi1, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with Cdk2. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, $T1$ interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human $T2$, Cdk2, and Cdk3, but not with Cdk4. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

Interaction of the protein nucleobindin with G alpha i2, as revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system. The heterotrimeric G protein, G alpha i2, transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with G alpha i2 by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length G alpha i2. Four positive colonies were obtained. Two of the four were identified as nucleobindin, a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti-nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus. Nucleobindin has a leucine zipper, EF hands, and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted. The specificity of intehraction between G alpha i2 and nucleobindin was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. Transfection of $T1$ and $T2$ in COS cells increased G alpha i2 expression relative to cells transfected with G alpha i2 and mock vector. Our results indicate that the yeast two-hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G alpha proteins. Nucleobindin appears to represent one of those proteins.

In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

Present data concerning the renin-angiotensin system of extrarenal origin. After a brief historical incursion regarding $T1$ of renal origin, we present the main extrarenal angiotensin-forming enzymes, starting with $T2$, tonin, D and G cathepsin and ending with the conversion enzyme and chymase. This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue RAS in the heart and vessels, brain and neurocranial accessory glands, cortico-suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory. In the end we refer to the relations between circulating RAS of renal origin and the extrarenal RAS specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two RAS components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system, regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria. While the circulating RAS of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions, tissue RAS, in paracrine or autocrine ways, exerts local-regional adaptive actions of long duration.

Functional participation of the $T1$$T2$ chain in IL-7 receptor complexes. The gamma chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional IL-4 receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of $T1$$T2$ was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, $T1$)-$T2$ ligand interaction. The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

Physical interaction of mammalian CDC37 with CDK4 .CDC37 was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of CDC28 with cyclins. The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of $T1$ with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and $T2$.

14-3-3 zeta negatively regulates raf-1 activity by interactions with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain. Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood. We recently reported that $T1$ interaction with the $T2$ cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 zeta binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD. Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD. Introduction of mutations that impair 14-3-3 binding resulted in full-length Raf-1 mutants with enhanced transforming activity. Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.

Assaying of tumor necrosis factor alpha, complement factors, and alpha-1-antitrypsin in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions. The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether TNFalpha, alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. One hundred forty-five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed. TNFalpha, alpha1AT, and complement factors C3 and C4 concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods. Serous effusions were classified as follows: 102 exudates and 43 transudates. All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion. In the stepwise discriminant analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant discriminant function (p < 0.001). Their order of selection was $T1$ effusion, $T2$ serum, TNFalpha-effusion, and C3 effusion. Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing exudates versus transudates) giving sensitivity = 93.14%; specificity = 90.70%; positive predictive value = 95.96%; negative predictive value = 84.78%. Determination of TNFalpha, complement factors C3 and C4, and alpha1AT may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions, particularly in those patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power.

Crystal structure of the hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE complexed with transferrin receptor. HFE is related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. $T1$ binds to the transferrin receptor ($T2$), a receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer. On a cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE-TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.

A direct interaction between G-protein beta gamma subunits and the Raf-1 protein kinase. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of $T1$ ($T2$) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.

A c-Cbl yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14-3-3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components. The protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including $T1$, Crk and $T2$, and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors. The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with c-Cbl in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction. The screen identified interactions involving c-Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein, SH3 P17. We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of c-Cbl required for its interaction with each of the proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, $T1$, and $T2$, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

The SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc: implications for insulin control of ras signalling. GRB2, a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sem-5. Both GRB2 and sem-5 have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates p21ras signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this report we show that in response to insulin, GRB2 forms a stable complex with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 and the second is the SH2 domain-containing oncogenic protein, Shc. The interactions between $T1$ and these two proteins require ligand activation of the $T2$ and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both IRS-1 and Shc. Although GRB2 associates with IRS-1 and Shc, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, implying that GRB2 is not a substrate for the insulin receptor. Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif (YV/IN) present in IRS-1, EGFR and Shc, which specifically binds the SH2 domain of GRB2 with high affinity. Interestingly, both GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same IRS-1 molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex. We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein--protein interactions between GRB2 and the two targets IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of p21ras and the control of downstream effector molecules.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, $T1$ initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B ($T2$). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4. The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by $T1$ ($T2$). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.

Expression cloning of a receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Two cDNA clones encoding a receptor for human $T1$ ($T2$) were isolated by expression screening of a library made from human placental mRNA. Pools of recombinant plasmid DNA were electroporated into COS cells which were then screened for their capacity to bind radioiodinated hGM-CSF using a sensitive microscopic autoradiographic approach. The cloned GM-CSF-R precursor is a 400 amino acid polypeptide (Mr 45,000) with a single transmembrane domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain and a short (54 amino acids) intracytoplasmic tail. It does not contain a tyrosine kinase domain nor show homology with members of the immunoglobulin super gene family, but does show some significant sequence homologies with receptors for several other haemopoietic growth factors, including those for interleukin-6, erythropoietin and interleukin-2 (beta-chain) and also to the prolactin receptor. When transfected into COS cells the cloned cDNA directed the expression of a GM-CSF-R showing a single class of affinity (KD = 2(-8) nM) and specificity for human GM-CSF but not interleukin-3. Messenger RNA coding for this receptor was detected in a variety of haemopoietic cells known to display hGM-CSF binding, and cross-linking experiments revealed a similar size for the glycosylated receptors in transfected COS and haemopoietic cells.

Cloning and expression of human TAFII250: a TBP-associated factor implicated in cell-cycle regulation. Basal transcription by human RNA polymerase II requires the coordinate action of several ancillary factors (TFIIA-J) and can be regulated by various promoter-specific DNA binding proteins. An additional class of factors, called coactivators, are dispensable for basal transcription but are indispensable for regulation by transcriptional activators. Biochemical studies established that some coactivators are associated with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form the TFIID complex. We therefore set out to define the relationship between TBP and these TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we describe the cloning, expression and properties of the first human TAF, hTAFII250. The $T1$ gene is identical to a gene, $T2$, (ref 7,8), implicated in cell-cycle progression. Recombinant hTAFII250 binds directly to TBP both in vitro and in yeast, and participates in the formation of the TFIID complex. This largest TAF may therefore play a central role in TFIID assembly by interacting with both TBP and other TAFs, as well as serving to link the control of transcription to the cell cycle.
