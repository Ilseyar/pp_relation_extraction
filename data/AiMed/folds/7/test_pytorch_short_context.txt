Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric $T1$$T2$) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex.

Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of $T1$ resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of $T2$.

CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of $T1$, $T2$ and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the $T1$ receptor (sIL-6R) and $T2$ have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex.

Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila $T1$ (dTBP), human TAFII250, $T2$, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not.

Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the $T1$ ($T2$) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta.

The high affinity interleukin-6 ($T1$) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific $T2$ receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130.

TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, $T1$, USF, $T2$, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain.

RESULTS: $T1$, AADC and $T2$ were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH.
