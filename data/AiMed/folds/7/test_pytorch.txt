Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, $T1$, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), $T2$, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, $T1$, p62, $T2$, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human $T1$ and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and $T2$ have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum $T1$ (RBP) to transthyretin ($T2$) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and $T1$$T2$ (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of $T1$ and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known $T2$ effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of $T1$, AADC and $T2$ were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the $T1$ complex, TAFII40 and $T2$, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Raf1 interaction with Cdc25 phosphatase ties mitogenic signal transduction to cell cycle activation. The Ras and Raf1 proto-oncogenes transduce extracellular signals that promote cell growth. Cdc25 phosphatases activate the cell division cycle by dephosphorylation of critical threonine and tyrosine residues within the cyclin-dependent kinases. We show here that Cdc25 phosphatase associates with raf1 in somatic mammalian cells and in meiotic frog oocytes. Furthermore, Cdc25 phosphatase can be activated in vitro in a Raf1-dependent manner. We suggest that activation of the cell cycle by the Ras/$T1$ pathways might be mediated in part by $T2$.

Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, $T1$ only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by $T2$ is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates $T1$$T2$ is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

The molar ratio of serum $T1$ (RBP) to transthyretin ($T2$) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection.

In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548).

RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds $T1$ also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between $T2$ and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid ($T1$-bicoid) failed to interact with the $T2$ fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, $T1$ ($T2$), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the $T1$$T2$ (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Immunohistochemical analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor family members in stage I non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: To elucidate the relationship between the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor family members (ErbB-1, neu/ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and $T1$$T2$, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4) and tumor recurrence. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of four epidermal growth factor receptor family members in 73 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Using Cox univariate analysis, we determined that angiolymphatic tumor emboli and non-well-differentiated tumor cells were two significant conventional pathologic predictors of tumor recurrence, and that ErbB-1 and ErbB-3 were also significant predictors. Co-expression of ErbB-1+, -3+, or expression of three or more epidermal growth factor receptor family members had a significant effect on lung cancer recurrence. A stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis provided a predictive model for tumor recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that in patients with a non-well-differentiated tumor, overexpression of ErbB-3 is a useful marker for predicting tumor recurrence. The present study also confirmed that ErbB-1 expression increased in proportion to the loss of tumor differentiation. The correlation between ErbB-3 and distant metastasis was good.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial $T1$ complex containing Drosophila $T2$ (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the $T1$:CBP interaction and report here that $T2$ can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, $T1$, and $T2$ (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo. The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPmu on the surface of one cell binds to PTPmu on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that $T1$ associates with a complex containing cadherins, alpha- and $T2$ in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of PTPmu binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to alpha- or beta-catenin. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including PTPmu, the cadherins associated with PTPmu are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTPmu. These data suggest that PTPmu may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.

The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human H-Ras bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein p120GAP (GAP-334) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of $T1$ is stabilized by $T2$, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and $T1$ bind specifically and stably to $T2$.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in $T1$:$T2$ ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection. SPONSORSHIP: Our research was partially supported by a grant from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique et Medicale (contract 3.4505.94) and the David and Alice Van Buuren Foundation.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and $T1$ bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of $T2$ and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form $T1$$T2$) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta.

No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and $T1$.$T2$. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, $T1$ is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with $T2$, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. $T1$ protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed $T2$-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length $T1$ interacts with activated $T2$ in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, $T1$, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of $T2$. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, $T1$, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and $T2$ (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Mutational analysis of thrombopoietin for identification of receptor and neutralizing antibody sites. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a hematopoietin important for megakaryocyte proliferation and production of blood platelets. We sought to characterize how TPO binds and activates its receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor. The erythropoietin-like domain of $T1$ (TPO1-153) has been fused to the $T2$ coat protein of M13 bacteriophage. Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent-exposed, based on a homology model. Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the TPO receptor and five anti-TPO1-153 monoclonal antibodies. Mutations at mostly positively charged residues (Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Lys59, Lys136, Lys138, Arg140) caused the greatest reduction in receptor-binding affinity. Most of these residues mapped to helices-1 and -4 and a loop region between helix-1 and helix-2. Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked TPO binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix-4. In contrast, the other three monoclonal antibodies, which were effective at blocking TPO activity but did not block initial binding of TPO to its receptor, had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3. These results suggest that TPO has two distinct receptor-binding sites that function to dimerize TPO receptors in a sequential fashion.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human $T1$ and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the $T2$ receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned $T1$, XPD, $T2$, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas $T1$$T2$, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Modulation of the transcriptional activity of thyroid hormone receptors by the tumor suppressor p53. Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent transcriptional factors that regulate growth, differentiation, and development. The molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate these effects are unclear. One prevailing hypothesis suggests that TRs may cooperate with other transcriptional factors to mediate their biological effects. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the activity of TRs is modulated by the tumor suppressor p53. p53 is a nuclear protein that regulates gene expression via sequence-specific DNA binding and/or direct protein-protein interaction. We found that the human TR subtype beta 1 (h-TR beta 1) physically interacted with p53 via its DNA binding domain. As a result of this physical interaction, binding of h-TR beta 1 to its hormone response elements either as homodimer or as a heterodimer with the $T1$ was inhibited by $T2$ in a concentration-dependent manner. In transfected cells, wild-type p53 repressed the hormone-dependent transcriptional activation of h-TR beta 1. In contrast, mutant p53 either had no effect or activated the transcriptional activity of h-TR beta 1 depending on the type of hormone response elements. These results indicate the gene regulating activity of TRs was modulated by p53, suggesting that the cross talk between these two transcriptional factors may play an important role in the biology of normal and cancer cells.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or $T1$, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by $T2$ and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. $T1$ protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with $T2$ protein.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, $T1$, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), $T2$, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an $T1$$T2$ transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human H-Ras bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein $T1$ ($T2$) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between $T1$ and other $T2$ effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric ($T1$) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor ($T2$) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and $T1$$T2$ and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How $T1$ acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of $T2$ essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the $T1$ complex, $T2$ and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed $T1$-$T2$ interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of $T1$, ErbB3 and $T2$ in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein.

Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of $T1$ (XPB and $T2$ proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

Immunohistochemical analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor family members in stage I non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: To elucidate the relationship between the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor family members (ErbB-1, neu/ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4) and tumor recurrence. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of four epidermal growth factor receptor family members in 73 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Using Cox univariate analysis, we determined that angiolymphatic tumor emboli and non-well-differentiated tumor cells were two significant conventional pathologic predictors of tumor recurrence, and that ErbB-1 and $T1$$T2$ and ErbB-3 were also significant predictors. Co-expression of ErbB-1+, -3+, or expression of three or more epidermal growth factor receptor family members had a significant effect on lung cancer recurrence. A stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis provided a predictive model for tumor recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that in patients with a non-well-differentiated tumor, overexpression of ErbB-3 is a useful marker for predicting tumor recurrence. The present study also confirmed that ErbB-1 expression increased in proportion to the loss of tumor differentiation. The correlation between ErbB-3 and distant metastasis was good.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to $T1$ through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the $T2$. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that $T1$ and $T2$ have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of $T1$ and employs some $T2$ determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial $T1$ complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, $T2$, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of $T1$$T2$ ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and $T1$, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the $T2$ protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that $T1$ and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting $T2$ to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and $T1$ were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-$T2$ and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, $T1$$T2$, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Modulation of the transcriptional activity of thyroid hormone receptors by the tumor suppressor p53. Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent transcriptional factors that regulate growth, differentiation, and development. The molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate these effects are unclear. One prevailing hypothesis suggests that TRs may cooperate with other transcriptional factors to mediate their biological effects. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the activity of TRs is modulated by the tumor suppressor p53. p53 is a nuclear protein that regulates gene expression via sequence-specific DNA binding and/or direct protein-protein interaction. We found that the human TR subtype beta 1 (h-TR beta 1) physically interacted with p53 via its DNA binding domain. As a result of this physical interaction, binding of $T1$ to its hormone response elements either as homodimer or as a heterodimer with the retinoic X receptor was inhibited by $T2$ in a concentration-dependent manner. In transfected cells, wild-type p53 repressed the hormone-dependent transcriptional activation of h-TR beta 1. In contrast, mutant p53 either had no effect or activated the transcriptional activity of h-TR beta 1 depending on the type of hormone response elements. These results indicate the gene regulating activity of TRs was modulated by p53, suggesting that the cross talk between these two transcriptional factors may play an important role in the biology of normal and cancer cells.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or $T1$, suggesting that signalling by $T2$ is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor ($T1$) and $T2$ have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to $T1$, but fails to form the $T2$. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that $T1$ and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with $T2$ for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between $T1$ components, the human NER protein XPG, and the $T2$ protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

$T1$ transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and $T2$. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 $T1$$T2$-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, $T1$, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and $T2$ (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-$T1$$T2$) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: $T1$, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-$T2$. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human H-Ras bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein p120GAP (GAP-334) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of $T1$ and glutamine-61 of $T2$, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, $T1$, CTF, adenoviral $T2$, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, $T1$ and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the $T2$ protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Immunohistochemical analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor family members in stage I non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: To elucidate the relationship between the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor family members ($T1$, neu/ErbB-2, $T2$, and ErbB-4) and tumor recurrence. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of four epidermal growth factor receptor family members in 73 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Using Cox univariate analysis, we determined that angiolymphatic tumor emboli and non-well-differentiated tumor cells were two significant conventional pathologic predictors of tumor recurrence, and that ErbB-1 and ErbB-3 were also significant predictors. Co-expression of ErbB-1+, -3+, or expression of three or more epidermal growth factor receptor family members had a significant effect on lung cancer recurrence. A stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis provided a predictive model for tumor recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that in patients with a non-well-differentiated tumor, overexpression of ErbB-3 is a useful marker for predicting tumor recurrence. The present study also confirmed that ErbB-1 expression increased in proportion to the loss of tumor differentiation. The correlation between ErbB-3 and distant metastasis was good.

OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, $T1$ and $T2$ were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant $T1$ induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of $T2$, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:$T1$ interaction and report here that $T2$ can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: $T1$/$T2$ molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, $T1$, p62, p44, and $T2$ genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein $T1$ (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed $T2$-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that $T1$ may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, $T2$. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 ($T1$) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific $T2$ and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and $T1$$T2$ complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of $T1$ and $T2$ are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like $T1$, was readily phosphorylated by $T2$ in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated $T1$ (aFGF) and basic FGF ($T2$) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor $T1$ through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator $T2$ (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

The $T1$-$T2$ complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human H-Ras bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein p120GAP (GAP-334) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and $T1$$T2$, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that $T1$ and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with $T2$; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein $T1$ and its partner $T2$. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase ($T1$), and $T2$ (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and $T1$ proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting $T2$ to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, $T1$, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules ($T2$) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). $T1$ is activated through phosphorylation by $T2$ (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric ($T1$$T2$-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-$T1$) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed $T2$-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds $T1$ also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other $T2$ effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 ($T1$) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein $T2$. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid ($T1$-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to $T2$, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking $T1$$T2$, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/$T1$$T2$/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned $T1$, $T2$, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

The bZIP domains of $T1$ and Jun mediate a physical association with the $T2$. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both $T1$ and $T2$.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, $T1$, and $T2$, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to $T1$ through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to $T2$, but fails to form the ActRII. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of $T1$, $T2$ and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular $T1$-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) ($T2$). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

B61 is a ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with $T1$ being an authentic ligand for $T2$. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of $T1$ and $T2$ in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. $T1$ protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to $T2$, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein ($T1$) to transthyretin ($T2$) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that $T1$ may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the $T2$ subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of $T1$ that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other $T2$ effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant $T1$ induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and $T2$ in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the $T1$ but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable $T2$ dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, $T1$, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and $T2$, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and $T1$ are necessary and sufficient for stable association with $T2$. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and $T1$$T2$ or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein ($T1$) to $T2$ (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). $T1$ is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A ($T2$), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Mutational analysis of thrombopoietin for identification of receptor and neutralizing antibody sites. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a hematopoietin important for megakaryocyte proliferation and production of blood platelets. We sought to characterize how TPO binds and activates its receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor. The erythropoietin-like domain of TPO (TPO1-153) has been fused to the gIII coat protein of M13 bacteriophage. Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent-exposed, based on a homology model. Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the TPO receptor and five anti-TPO1-153 monoclonal antibodies. Mutations at mostly positively charged residues (Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Lys59, Lys136, Lys138, Arg140) caused the greatest reduction in receptor-binding affinity. Most of these residues mapped to helices-1 and -4 and a loop region between helix-1 and helix-2. Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked TPO binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix-4. In contrast, the other three monoclonal antibodies, which were effective at blocking TPO activity but did not block initial binding of TPO to its receptor, had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3. These results suggest that $T1$ has two distinct receptor-binding sites that function to dimerize $T2$ receptors in a sequential fashion.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, $T1$ (TH), $T2$ (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. $T1$ is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 $T2$ proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of $T1$, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein $T2$, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and $T1$$T2$ and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. $T1$ interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some $T2$ determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human H-Ras bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein p120GAP (GAP-334) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of $T1$ is supplied into the active site of $T2$ to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, $T1$$T2$, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, $T1$ (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules ($T2$) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric ($T1$) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of $T2$ dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Modulation of the transcriptional activity of thyroid hormone receptors by the tumor suppressor p53. Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent transcriptional factors that regulate growth, differentiation, and development. The molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate these effects are unclear. One prevailing hypothesis suggests that TRs may cooperate with other transcriptional factors to mediate their biological effects. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the activity of TRs is modulated by the tumor suppressor p53. p53 is a nuclear protein that regulates gene expression via sequence-specific DNA binding and/or direct protein-protein interaction. We found that the human $T1$ ($T2$) physically interacted with p53 via its DNA binding domain. As a result of this physical interaction, binding of h-TR beta 1 to its hormone response elements either as homodimer or as a heterodimer with the retinoic X receptor was inhibited by p53 in a concentration-dependent manner. In transfected cells, wild-type p53 repressed the hormone-dependent transcriptional activation of h-TR beta 1. In contrast, mutant p53 either had no effect or activated the transcriptional activity of h-TR beta 1 depending on the type of hormone response elements. These results indicate the gene regulating activity of TRs was modulated by p53, suggesting that the cross talk between these two transcriptional factors may play an important role in the biology of normal and cancer cells.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant $T1$ induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, $T2$ and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human $T1$, dTAFII60, and $T2$ supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, $T1$ augments the activity of phosphorylated $T2$ to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring $T1$ (beta-galactosidase) and $T2$ (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to $T1$ ($T2$) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection. SPONSORSHIP: Our research was partially supported by a grant from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique et Medicale (contract 3.4505.94) and the David and Alice Van Buuren Foundation.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I ($T1$$T2$ (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of $T1$ and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of $T2$, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, $T1$ and $T2$ in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and $T1$ ($T2$) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, $T1$, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of $T2$) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and $T1$$T2$ and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the $T1$ ($T2$), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral $T1$, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 $T2$ proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-$T1$$T2$, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, $T1$$T2$, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 ($T1$$T2$ (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of $T1$ interacts with the basal transcription factor $T2$ through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with $T1$ and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by $T2$ is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human $T1$ bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein $T2$ (GAP-334) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein $T1$, and Cockayne syndrome group B ($T2$) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila $T1$ (dTBP), human $T2$, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the $T1$($T2$)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of $T1$ directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, $T2$. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a $T1$$T2$ fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules ($T1$) sP- and sE-selectin, $T2$, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), $T1$ (AADC), and $T2$ (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Crystal structure of the BMP-2-BRIA ectodomain complex. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals. Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II. Here we report the crystal structure of human dimeric $T1$ in complex with two high affinity $T2$s(BRIAec). The receptor chains bind to the 'wrist' epitopes of the BMP-2 dimer and contact both BMP-2 monomers. No contacts exist between the receptor domains. The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor-ligand interactions that is seen in BMP-TGF-beta systems.

Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, $T1$$T2$ has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar $T1$:$T2$ ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and $T1$ (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and $T2$. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and $T1$ bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and $T2$ are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Raf1 interaction with Cdc25 phosphatase ties mitogenic signal transduction to cell cycle activation. The Ras and Raf1 proto-oncogenes transduce extracellular signals that promote cell growth. Cdc25 phosphatases activate the cell division cycle by dephosphorylation of critical threonine and tyrosine residues within the cyclin-dependent kinases. We show here that Cdc25 phosphatase associates with raf1 in somatic mammalian cells and in meiotic frog oocytes. Furthermore, Cdc25 phosphatase can be activated in vitro in a Raf1-dependent manner. We suggest that activation of the cell cycle by the Ras/$T1$$T2$/Raf1 pathways might be mediated in part by Cdc25.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and $T1$$T2$ supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines $T1$, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and $T2$ (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Mutational analysis of thrombopoietin for identification of receptor and neutralizing antibody sites. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a hematopoietin important for megakaryocyte proliferation and production of blood platelets. We sought to characterize how $T1$ binds and activates its receptor, $T2$. The erythropoietin-like domain of TPO (TPO1-153) has been fused to the gIII coat protein of M13 bacteriophage. Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent-exposed, based on a homology model. Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the TPO receptor and five anti-TPO1-153 monoclonal antibodies. Mutations at mostly positively charged residues (Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Lys59, Lys136, Lys138, Arg140) caused the greatest reduction in receptor-binding affinity. Most of these residues mapped to helices-1 and -4 and a loop region between helix-1 and helix-2. Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked TPO binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix-4. In contrast, the other three monoclonal antibodies, which were effective at blocking TPO activity but did not block initial binding of TPO to its receptor, had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3. These results suggest that TPO has two distinct receptor-binding sites that function to dimerize TPO receptors in a sequential fashion.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of $T1$ and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with $T2$. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: $T1$, $T2$ and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, $T1$, and $T2$ genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and $T1$$T2$) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

Immunohistochemical analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor family members in stage I non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: To elucidate the relationship between the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor family members ($T1$, neu/$T2$, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4) and tumor recurrence. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of four epidermal growth factor receptor family members in 73 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Using Cox univariate analysis, we determined that angiolymphatic tumor emboli and non-well-differentiated tumor cells were two significant conventional pathologic predictors of tumor recurrence, and that ErbB-1 and ErbB-3 were also significant predictors. Co-expression of ErbB-1+, -3+, or expression of three or more epidermal growth factor receptor family members had a significant effect on lung cancer recurrence. A stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis provided a predictive model for tumor recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that in patients with a non-well-differentiated tumor, overexpression of ErbB-3 is a useful marker for predicting tumor recurrence. The present study also confirmed that ErbB-1 expression increased in proportion to the loss of tumor differentiation. The correlation between ErbB-3 and distant metastasis was good.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of $T1$ and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific $T2$ receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an $T1$$T2$-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, $T1$, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 $T2$ proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. $T1$ also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to $T2$, but fails to form the ActRII. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Mutational analysis of thrombopoietin for identification of receptor and neutralizing antibody sites. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a hematopoietin important for megakaryocyte proliferation and production of blood platelets. We sought to characterize how TPO binds and activates its receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor. The erythropoietin-like domain of TPO (TPO1-153) has been fused to the gIII coat protein of M13 bacteriophage. Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent-exposed, based on a homology model. Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the TPO receptor and five anti-$T1$$T2$ receptor and five anti-TPO1-153 monoclonal antibodies. Mutations at mostly positively charged residues (Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Lys59, Lys136, Lys138, Arg140) caused the greatest reduction in receptor-binding affinity. Most of these residues mapped to helices-1 and -4 and a loop region between helix-1 and helix-2. Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked TPO binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix-4. In contrast, the other three monoclonal antibodies, which were effective at blocking TPO activity but did not block initial binding of TPO to its receptor, had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3. These results suggest that TPO has two distinct receptor-binding sites that function to dimerize TPO receptors in a sequential fashion.

The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human $T1$ bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human $T2$ p120GAP (GAP-334) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the $T1$:$T2$ interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 $T1$$T2$ is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Identification of interaction partners for the basic-helix-loop-helix protein E47. Helix-loop-helix proteins constitute a family of transcription factors with the potential to form homo- and hetero-dimers mediated by the helix-loop-helix domain. Oncogenic mutations in such genes can disrupt the equilibrium of protein-protein interactions in the affected cell. In order to assess the biological consequences of such mutations, the full complement of interacting proteins must be known. To identify proteins interacting with the basic-helix-loop-helix domain of the ubiquitously expressed E47 protein, a 'sandwich'-screening procedure was developed which distinguishes between homo- and hetero-oligomers, and specifically excludes the detection of complexes which cannot bind DNA. Nine distinct cDNAs were identified which encode proteins with apparent basic-helix-loop-helix domains, including a novel clone termed eip1 which is distantly related in the basic-helix-loop-helix domain to the Drosophila enhancer-of-split m7 protein. Using epitope-tagging, interaction of E47 basic-helix-loop-helix protein with the eip1 protein encoded by this novel cDNA was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments in COS7 cells. Interaction was also observed in the yeast two-hybrid system. Three cDNAs encoding proteins without basic-helix-loop-helix domains were also found to interact in the sandwich-expression screen. Interactions with human $T1$ and mouse $T2$ were confirmed using glutathione transferase-tagged cDNAs. A cDNA encoding part of the nucleolin protein sequence interacted with the E47 basic-helix-loop-helix only when fused to a beta-galactosidase tag.

Raf1 interaction with Cdc25 phosphatase ties mitogenic signal transduction to cell cycle activation. The Ras and $T1$$T2$ and Raf1 proto-oncogenes transduce extracellular signals that promote cell growth. Cdc25 phosphatases activate the cell division cycle by dephosphorylation of critical threonine and tyrosine residues within the cyclin-dependent kinases. We show here that Cdc25 phosphatase associates with raf1 in somatic mammalian cells and in meiotic frog oocytes. Furthermore, Cdc25 phosphatase can be activated in vitro in a Raf1-dependent manner. We suggest that activation of the cell cycle by the Ras/Raf1 pathways might be mediated in part by Cdc25.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, $T1$, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and $T2$ (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Nuclear protein $T1$ is a coactivator for the transcription factor $T2$. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo. The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., $T1$ on the surface of one cell binds to $T2$ on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that PTPmu associates with a complex containing cadherins, alpha- and beta-catenin in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of PTPmu binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to alpha- or beta-catenin. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including PTPmu, the cadherins associated with PTPmu are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTPmu. These data suggest that PTPmu may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase ($T1$), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase ($T2$), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and $T1$ proteins to interact directly with the $T2$ (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors ($T1$, $T2$ and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-$T1$) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to $T2$, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned $T1$, XPD, p62, p44, and $T2$ genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

Mutational analysis of thrombopoietin for identification of receptor and neutralizing antibody sites. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a hematopoietin important for megakaryocyte proliferation and production of blood platelets. We sought to characterize how TPO binds and activates its receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor. The erythropoietin-like domain of TPO (TPO1-153) has been fused to the gIII coat protein of M13 bacteriophage. Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent-exposed, based on a homology model. Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the TPO receptor and five anti-TPO1-153 monoclonal antibodies. Mutations at mostly positively charged residues (Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Lys59, Lys136, Lys138, Arg140) caused the greatest reduction in receptor-binding affinity. Most of these residues mapped to helices-1 and -4 and a loop region between helix-1 and helix-2. Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked TPO binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix-4. In contrast, the other three monoclonal antibodies, which were effective at blocking $T1$ activity but did not block initial binding of $T2$ to its receptor, had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3. These results suggest that TPO has two distinct receptor-binding sites that function to dimerize TPO receptors in a sequential fashion.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, $T1$, and $T2$ mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that NF-kappaB activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of $T1$ and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific $T2$ and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and $T1$$T2$ and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines $T1$, $T2$, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. $T1$ interacts with the "effector domain" of $T2$ and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the $T1$ encoded polypeptide, which was denoted $T2$. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human $T1$ bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein p120GAP ($T2$) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of $T1$, $T2$ and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of $T1$ interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator $T2$ (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: $T1$, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-$T2$, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular $T1$ of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) ($T2$). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila $T1$ (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and $T2$ supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the $T1$ ($T2$)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that $T1$ is associated with both $T2$ and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with $T1$ and/or $T2$, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

B61 is a ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant $T1$ induces autophosphorylation of $T2$ in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for ECK. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, $T1$, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 $T2$ proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, $T1$, that binds specifically to the $T2$-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the $T1$ ($T2$) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, $T1$ and $T2$ were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both $T1$ and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to $T2$.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Raf1 interaction with Cdc25 phosphatase ties mitogenic signal transduction to cell cycle activation. The Ras and Raf1 proto-oncogenes transduce extracellular signals that promote cell growth. Cdc25 phosphatases activate the cell division cycle by dephosphorylation of critical threonine and tyrosine residues within the cyclin-dependent kinases. We show here that Cdc25 phosphatase associates with raf1 in somatic mammalian cells and in meiotic frog oocytes. Furthermore, Cdc25 phosphatase can be activated in vitro in a Raf1-dependent manner. We suggest that activation of the cell cycle by the Ras/Raf1 pathways might be mediated in part by $T1$$T2$/Raf1 pathways might be mediated in part by Cdc25.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, $T1$, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and $T2$, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF ($T1$) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both $T2$ and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial $T1$ complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and $T2$ supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a $T1$$T2$ binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

$T1$ is a ligand for the $T2$. A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for ECK. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.

Mutational analysis of thrombopoietin for identification of receptor and neutralizing antibody sites. Thrombopoietin ($T1$$T2$ (TPO) is a hematopoietin important for megakaryocyte proliferation and production of blood platelets. We sought to characterize how TPO binds and activates its receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor. The erythropoietin-like domain of TPO (TPO1-153) has been fused to the gIII coat protein of M13 bacteriophage. Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent-exposed, based on a homology model. Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the TPO receptor and five anti-TPO1-153 monoclonal antibodies. Mutations at mostly positively charged residues (Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Lys59, Lys136, Lys138, Arg140) caused the greatest reduction in receptor-binding affinity. Most of these residues mapped to helices-1 and -4 and a loop region between helix-1 and helix-2. Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked TPO binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix-4. In contrast, the other three monoclonal antibodies, which were effective at blocking TPO activity but did not block initial binding of TPO to its receptor, had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3. These results suggest that TPO has two distinct receptor-binding sites that function to dimerize TPO receptors in a sequential fashion.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form $T1$$T2$ (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-$T1$) failed to interact with the $T2$ fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric ($T1$ $T2$ gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the $T1$ binding domain of $T2$ can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to $T1$ ($T2$) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection. SPONSORSHIP: Our research was partially supported by a grant from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique et Medicale (contract 3.4505.94) and the David and Alice Van Buuren Foundation.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that $T1$ and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to $T2$. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, $T1$ (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and $T2$ (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

The bZIP domains of $T1$ and $T2$ mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, $T1$ and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-$T2$ and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, $T1$, $T2$, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking $T1$$T2$ (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, $T1$ only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by $T2$ and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Immunohistochemical analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor family members in stage I non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: To elucidate the relationship between the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor family members (ErbB-1, neu/ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and $T1$$T2$, neu/ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4) and tumor recurrence. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of four epidermal growth factor receptor family members in 73 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Using Cox univariate analysis, we determined that angiolymphatic tumor emboli and non-well-differentiated tumor cells were two significant conventional pathologic predictors of tumor recurrence, and that ErbB-1 and ErbB-3 were also significant predictors. Co-expression of ErbB-1+, -3+, or expression of three or more epidermal growth factor receptor family members had a significant effect on lung cancer recurrence. A stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis provided a predictive model for tumor recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that in patients with a non-well-differentiated tumor, overexpression of ErbB-3 is a useful marker for predicting tumor recurrence. The present study also confirmed that ErbB-1 expression increased in proportion to the loss of tumor differentiation. The correlation between ErbB-3 and distant metastasis was good.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF ($T1$) and $T2$ (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient $T1$$T2$ interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein $T1$ (LexA-$T2$) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of $T1$ and $T2$ proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, $T1$$T2$, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein $T1$, and the $T2$ protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, $T1$ was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by $T2$ in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient $T1$$T2$ but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Modulation of the transcriptional activity of thyroid hormone receptors by the tumor suppressor p53. Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent transcriptional factors that regulate growth, differentiation, and development. The molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate these effects are unclear. One prevailing hypothesis suggests that TRs may cooperate with other transcriptional factors to mediate their biological effects. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the activity of TRs is modulated by the tumor suppressor p53. p53 is a nuclear protein that regulates gene expression via sequence-specific DNA binding and/or direct protein-protein interaction. We found that the human TR subtype beta 1 (h-TR beta 1) physically interacted with p53 via its DNA binding domain. As a result of this physical interaction, binding of $T1$ to its hormone response elements either as homodimer or as a heterodimer with the $T2$ was inhibited by p53 in a concentration-dependent manner. In transfected cells, wild-type p53 repressed the hormone-dependent transcriptional activation of h-TR beta 1. In contrast, mutant p53 either had no effect or activated the transcriptional activity of h-TR beta 1 depending on the type of hormone response elements. These results indicate the gene regulating activity of TRs was modulated by p53, suggesting that the cross talk between these two transcriptional factors may play an important role in the biology of normal and cancer cells.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, $T1$, adenoviral $T2$, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Structural interactions of fibroblast growth factor receptor with its ligands. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) effect cellular responses by binding to FGF receptors (FGFRs). FGF bound to extracellular domains on the FGFR in the presence of heparin activates the cytoplasmic receptor tyrosine kinase through autophosphorylation. We have crystallized a complex between human $T1$ and a two-domain extracellular fragment of human $T2$. The crystal structure, determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction analysis of the selenomethionyl protein, is a dimeric assemblage of 1:1 ligand:receptor complexes. FGF is bound at the junction between the two domains of one FGFR, and two such units are associated through receptor:receptor and secondary ligand:receptor interfaces. Sulfate ion positions appear to mark the course of heparin binding between FGF molecules through a basic region on receptor D2 domains. This dimeric assemblage provides a structural mechanism for FGF signal transduction.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF ($T1$) and basic FGF ($T2$) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

One prevailing hypothesis suggests that TRs may cooperate with other transcriptional factors to mediate their biological effects. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the activity of TRs is modulated by the tumor suppressor p53. p53 is a nuclear protein that regulates gene expression via sequence-specific DNA binding and/or direct protein-protein interaction. We found that the human $T1$ (h-TR beta 1) physically interacted with $T2$ via its DNA binding domain. As a result of this physical interaction, binding of h-TR beta 1 to its hormone response elements either as homodimer or as a heterodimer with the retinoic X receptor was inhibited by p53 in a concentration-dependent manner. In transfected cells, wild-type p53 repressed the hormone-dependent transcriptional activation of h-TR beta 1. In contrast, mutant p53 either had no effect or activated the transcriptional activity of h-TR beta 1 depending on the type of hormone response elements. These results indicate the gene regulating activity of TRs was modulated by p53, suggesting that the cross talk between these two transcriptional factors may play an important role in the biology of normal and cancer cells.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of $T1$ and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and $T2$, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human H-Ras bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein p120GAP ($T1$$T2$ p120GAP (GAP-334) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

Modulation of the transcriptional activity of thyroid hormone receptors by the tumor suppressor p53. Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent transcriptional factors that regulate growth, differentiation, and development. The molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate these effects are unclear. One prevailing hypothesis suggests that TRs may cooperate with other transcriptional factors to mediate their biological effects. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the activity of TRs is modulated by the tumor suppressor p53. p53 is a nuclear protein that regulates gene expression via sequence-specific DNA binding and/or direct protein-protein interaction. We found that the human TR subtype beta 1 (h-TR beta 1) physically interacted with p53 via its DNA binding domain. As a result of this physical interaction, binding of h-TR beta 1 to its hormone response elements either as homodimer or as a heterodimer with the retinoic X receptor was inhibited by p53 in a concentration-dependent manner. In transfected cells, wild-type p53 repressed the hormone-dependent transcriptional activation of h-TR beta 1. In contrast, mutant $T1$ either had no effect or activated the transcriptional activity of $T2$ depending on the type of hormone response elements. These results indicate the gene regulating activity of TRs was modulated by p53, suggesting that the cross talk between these two transcriptional factors may play an important role in the biology of normal and cancer cells.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. $T1$ complexes in which an $T2$ chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or $T1$, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or $T2$ receptors.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How $T1$ acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the $T2$ protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a $T1$$T2$ was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated $T1$ (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and $T2$. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with $T1$$T2$ and with CSB protein.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas $T1$$T2$), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines $T1$, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and $T2$ (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-$T1$$T2$-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor ($T1$) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of $T2$ dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH ($T1$ and $T2$ proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

Signal transduction pathway of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Identification of a novel 66-kDa phosphoprotein. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) results in a variety of functional effects, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, -2, -4, and -6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated $T1$ predominantly interacts with $T2$. Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H. GRB2. Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2. Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2. Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc. GRB2. Sos and 80K-H.pp66. GRB2. Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein $T1$ (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the $T2$ fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, $T1$ only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or $T2$ receptors.

Two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin D1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the Rb protein .Originally identified as a 'mitotic cyclin', cyclin A exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an S-phase-promoting factor (SPF) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene. Other recent studies have identified human cyclin D1 (PRAD1) as a putative G1 cyclin and candidate proto-oncogene. However, the specific enzymatic activities and, hence, the precise biochemical mechanisms through which cyclins function to govern cell cycle progression remain unresolved. In the present study we have investigated the coordinate interactions between these two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks) and the Rb tumor-suppressor protein. The distribution of cyclin D isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin A, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro. In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with p9Ckshs1, a Cdk-binding subunit. Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing's sarcoma cells demonstrated that $T1$ is associated with both p34cdc2 and $T2$, and that cyclin D1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity. Immobilized, recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the p105Rb protein. This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry, including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the Rb protein, that may ultimately relate membrane-mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. $T1$ also binds to $T2$ through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Crystal structure of the $T1$-$T2$ ectodomain complex. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals. Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II. Here we report the crystal structure of human dimeric BMP-2 in complex with two high affinity BMP receptor IA extracellular domains(BRIAec). The receptor chains bind to the 'wrist' epitopes of the BMP-2 dimer and contact both BMP-2 monomers. No contacts exist between the receptor domains. The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor-ligand interactions that is seen in BMP-TGF-beta systems.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and $T1$ were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-$T2$. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Raf1 interaction with Cdc25 phosphatase ties mitogenic signal transduction to cell cycle activation. The Ras and Raf1 proto-oncogenes transduce extracellular signals that promote cell growth. Cdc25 phosphatases activate the cell division cycle by dephosphorylation of critical threonine and tyrosine residues within the cyclin-dependent kinases. We show here that $T1$ associates with $T2$ in somatic mammalian cells and in meiotic frog oocytes. Furthermore, Cdc25 phosphatase can be activated in vitro in a Raf1-dependent manner. We suggest that activation of the cell cycle by the Ras/Raf1 pathways might be mediated in part by Cdc25.

The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human H-Ras bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein $T1$$T2$ p120GAP (GAP-334) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

The bZIP domains of Fos and $T1$ mediate a physical association with the $T2$. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and $T1$$T2$, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-$T1$ and AAV-$T2$. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and $T1$$T2$ (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:$T1$ binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase $T2$ to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Immunohistochemical analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor family members in stage I non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: To elucidate the relationship between the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor family members (ErbB-1, neu/ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and $T1$$T2$, and ErbB-4) and tumor recurrence. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of four epidermal growth factor receptor family members in 73 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Using Cox univariate analysis, we determined that angiolymphatic tumor emboli and non-well-differentiated tumor cells were two significant conventional pathologic predictors of tumor recurrence, and that ErbB-1 and ErbB-3 were also significant predictors. Co-expression of ErbB-1+, -3+, or expression of three or more epidermal growth factor receptor family members had a significant effect on lung cancer recurrence. A stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis provided a predictive model for tumor recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that in patients with a non-well-differentiated tumor, overexpression of ErbB-3 is a useful marker for predicting tumor recurrence. The present study also confirmed that ErbB-1 expression increased in proportion to the loss of tumor differentiation. The correlation between ErbB-3 and distant metastasis was good.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to $T1$$T2$) to transthyretin (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection. SPONSORSHIP: Our research was partially supported by a grant from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique et Medicale (contract 3.4505.94) and the David and Alice Van Buuren Foundation.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. $T1$ and sP- and $T2$ levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-$T1$$T2$ fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Raf1 interaction with Cdc25 phosphatase ties mitogenic signal transduction to cell cycle activation. The Ras and Raf1 proto-oncogenes transduce extracellular signals that promote cell growth. Cdc25 phosphatases activate the cell division cycle by dephosphorylation of critical threonine and tyrosine residues within the cyclin-dependent kinases. We show here that Cdc25 phosphatase associates with raf1 in somatic mammalian cells and in meiotic frog oocytes. Furthermore, $T1$ can be activated in vitro in a $T2$-dependent manner. We suggest that activation of the cell cycle by the Ras/Raf1 pathways might be mediated in part by Cdc25.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The $T1$-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila $T2$. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis.

The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels.

Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that $T1$ and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between $T2$ and the initiation complex.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the $T1$$T2$ ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking $T1$$T2$), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ ($T1$) and LEU2 ($T2$) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically and stably to $T1$.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with $T2$. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with $T1$ and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by $T2$ and/or ErbB4 receptors.

The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein ($T1$) to transthyretin ($T2$) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection. SPONSORSHIP: Our research was partially supported by a grant from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique et Medicale (contract 3.4505.94) and the David and Alice Van Buuren Foundation.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between $T1$ components, the human NER protein $T2$, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

Modulation of the transcriptional activity of thyroid hormone receptors by the tumor suppressor p53. Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent transcriptional factors that regulate growth, differentiation, and development. The molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate these effects are unclear. One prevailing hypothesis suggests that TRs may cooperate with other transcriptional factors to mediate their biological effects. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the activity of TRs is modulated by the tumor suppressor p53. p53 is a nuclear protein that regulates gene expression via sequence-specific DNA binding and/or direct protein-protein interaction. We found that the human TR subtype beta 1 (h-TR beta 1) physically interacted with p53 via its DNA binding domain. As a result of this physical interaction, binding of h-TR beta 1 to its hormone response elements either as homodimer or as a heterodimer with the retinoic X receptor was inhibited by p53 in a concentration-dependent manner. In transfected cells, wild-type $T1$ repressed the hormone-dependent transcriptional activation of $T2$. In contrast, mutant p53 either had no effect or activated the transcriptional activity of h-TR beta 1 depending on the type of hormone response elements. These results indicate the gene regulating activity of TRs was modulated by p53, suggesting that the cross talk between these two transcriptional factors may play an important role in the biology of normal and cancer cells.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules ($T1$) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and $T2$ (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Mutational analysis of thrombopoietin for identification of receptor and neutralizing antibody sites. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a hematopoietin important for megakaryocyte proliferation and production of blood platelets. We sought to characterize how TPO binds and activates its receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor. The $T1$-like domain of $T2$ (TPO1-153) has been fused to the gIII coat protein of M13 bacteriophage. Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent-exposed, based on a homology model. Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the TPO receptor and five anti-TPO1-153 monoclonal antibodies. Mutations at mostly positively charged residues (Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Lys59, Lys136, Lys138, Arg140) caused the greatest reduction in receptor-binding affinity. Most of these residues mapped to helices-1 and -4 and a loop region between helix-1 and helix-2. Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked TPO binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix-4. In contrast, the other three monoclonal antibodies, which were effective at blocking TPO activity but did not block initial binding of TPO to its receptor, had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3. These results suggest that TPO has two distinct receptor-binding sites that function to dimerize TPO receptors in a sequential fashion.

Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor($T1$$T2$ gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

The molar ratio of serum $T1$ (RBP) to $T2$ (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection. SPONSORSHIP: Our research was partially supported by a grant from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique et Medicale (contract 3.4505.94) and the David and Alice Van Buuren Foundation.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, $T1$ and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-$T2$. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of $T1$ and two subunits of the $T2$ complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric ($T1$) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the $T2$ receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by $T1$ ($T2$) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, $T1$ (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, $T2$, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and $T1$$T2$, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. $T1$ interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of $T2$, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and $T1$$T2$), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the $T1$ protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of $T2$ essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates $T1$$T2$ (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), $T1$ ($T2$), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 regulation.

A cellular protein that competes with SV40 T antigen for binding to the retinoblastoma gene product. Tumour-suppressor genes, such as the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb), are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation. This role is indicated, in part, by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus-mediated Rb replacement. How Rb acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the Rb protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses, and that two regions of Rb essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells. These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of Rb and thereby mediate its function. We report here the identification of one such human cellular Rb-associated protein of relative molecular mass 46,000 (46K) (RbAP46). Two lines of evidence support the notion that $T1$ and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous $T2$-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb. The apparent targeting of the RbAP46-Rb interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo. The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPmu on the surface of one cell binds to PTPmu on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that PTPmu associates with a complex containing cadherins, alpha- and beta-catenin in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of $T1$ binds directly to the intracellular domain of $T2$, but not to alpha- or beta-catenin. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including PTPmu, the cadherins associated with PTPmu are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTPmu. These data suggest that PTPmu may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.

The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun mediate a physical association with the TATA box-binding protein. Fos and Jun oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 binding sites. These two proteins, like other transcriptional activators, are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and/or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery. The ability of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to interact directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes, was investigated. Using co-immunoprecipitation and protein-protein association assays, we show that both $T1$ and $T2$ bind specifically and stably to TBP.Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun are necessary and sufficient for stable association with TBP. A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of TBP, previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. We propose that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins function as transcriptional activators, in part by recruiting TBP to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated $T1$ (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both $T2$ and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function. Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector domain" of RAS and employs some $T1$ determinants that are common to, and others that are distinct from, those required for the binding of $T2$, a known RAS effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas $T1$$T2$, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 $T1$ $T2$)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Mutational analysis of thrombopoietin for identification of receptor and neutralizing antibody sites. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a hematopoietin important for megakaryocyte proliferation and production of blood platelets. We sought to characterize how TPO binds and activates its receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor. The $T1$-like domain of TPO (TPO1-153) has been fused to the $T2$ coat protein of M13 bacteriophage. Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent-exposed, based on a homology model. Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the TPO receptor and five anti-TPO1-153 monoclonal antibodies. Mutations at mostly positively charged residues (Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Lys59, Lys136, Lys138, Arg140) caused the greatest reduction in receptor-binding affinity. Most of these residues mapped to helices-1 and -4 and a loop region between helix-1 and helix-2. Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked TPO binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix-4. In contrast, the other three monoclonal antibodies, which were effective at blocking TPO activity but did not block initial binding of TPO to its receptor, had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3. These results suggest that TPO has two distinct receptor-binding sites that function to dimerize TPO receptors in a sequential fashion.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, $T1$, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and soluble cell adhesion molecules ($T2$) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed. Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase ($T1$), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I ($T2$, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of TH, AADC and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase $T1$$T2$ (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAFII250, dTAFII60, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and $T1$ are important targets for transmitting activation signals between $T2$ and the initiation complex.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-$T1$$T2$-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Endothelin-1 and sP- and sE-selectin levels were not related to function of lymphocytes (by MDM data) as seen in both tests; it is probable that another cell-cell communication mechanism had been switched on. We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10, which are the active participants in the pro- and anti-inflammatory program in atherogenesis. Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine-like sCAM activity in atherosclerosis.

Interactions involving the human RNA polymerase II transcription/nucleotide excision repair complex TFIIH, the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG, and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein. The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, $T1$$T2$, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.

Interaction between cell cycle regulator, E2F-1, and NF-kappaB mediates repression of HIV-1 gene transcription. The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV-1 gene expression. Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-kappaB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-kappaB mediated transcription in a cell-free system. Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites in E2F-1 mediated repression of HIV-1 promoter, in vivo. The results of this study suggest that $T1$ activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein, $T2$.

Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene. Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, $T1$ only activates those with ErbB3 and/or $T2$, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.

Influence of interleukin-6 (IL-6) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric $T1$$T2$) dimerization on formation of the high affinity hexameric IL-6.receptor complex. The high affinity interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific IL-6 receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130. Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex. Although IL-6D has a higher binding affinity for immobilized sIL-6R, as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection, IL-6M is more potent than IL-6D in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay. The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time-dependent dissociation at 37 degrees C of IL-6 dimers into active monomers. The increased binding affinity of IL-6D appears to be due to its ability to cross-link two sIL-6R molecules on the biosensor surface. Studies of the IL-6 ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of IL-6D resulted from a decreased ability of the IL-6D (sIL-6R)2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of gp130. These data imply that IL-6-induced dimerization of sIL-6R is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric (IL-6 IL-6R gp130)2 complex. A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of IL-6R, gp130, and IL-6M forms before the functional hexamer. Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with gp130, we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient IL-6 antagonist.

Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. METHODS: The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH, an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors. Expressions of TH, AADC and GCH were detected by Western blot analysis. Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: TH, AADC and GCH were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors, AAV-TH, AAV-AADC and AAV-GCH. Furthermore, the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells. CONCLUSION: The triple transduction of $T1$, $T2$ and GCH genes with separate AAV vectors is effective, which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

p53 transcriptional activation mediated by coactivators TAFII40 and TAFII60. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor IID (TFIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TFIID complex, TAFII40 and TAFII60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAFII40 and TAFII60. Furthermore, a partial TFIID complex containing Drosophila $T1$ (dTBP), human TAFII250, $T2$, and dTAFII40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAFII40 and TAFII60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAFII40 and TAFII60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.

Inhibin antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant-negative mechanism. The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the $T1$ ($T2$) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, $T1$, USF, $T2$, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

The molar ratio of serum $T1$ ($T2$) to transthyretin (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) to transthyretin (TTR) to determine vitamin A (VA) status during infection. DESIGN: We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the RBP/TTR ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status. In this clinical trial, children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA (200 000 IU) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA (5000 IU) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge. SETTING: Lwiro pediatric hospital, Province of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. SUBJECTS: A total of 900 children aged 0-72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RBP/TTR molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation. RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection. SPONSORSHIP: Our research was partially supported by a grant from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique et Medicale (contract 3.4505.94) and the David and Alice Van Buuren Foundation.

Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and sCAM in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis. Comparative analysis of cytokines and sCAM secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis. Two types of response were studied: coagulation and fibrinolysis (incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer (shear rate 100 l/s, 60 seconds at 37 degrees C, and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C). Cytokines $T1$, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 (Immunotech, France), $T2$, and soluble cell adhesion molecules (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA). The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph (Russia) and smears dyed specifically for DNA. Correlational changes in morphodensitometric (MDM) parameters and cytokine and sCAM levels in two tests were compared to initial levels. After rheologic testing, lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed, but chromatin activity had decreased. Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed.

Two-hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta-amyloid peptide monomers. The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring $T1$ ($T2$) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.

Crystal structure of the BMP-2-BRIA ectodomain complex. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals. Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II. Here we report the crystal structure of human dimeric $T1$ in complex with two high affinity BMP receptor IA extracellular domains($T2$). The receptor chains bind to the 'wrist' epitopes of the BMP-2 dimer and contact both BMP-2 monomers. No contacts exist between the receptor domains. The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor-ligand interactions that is seen in BMP-TGF-beta systems.

Nuclear protein CBP is a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the $T1$-phosphorylated form of $T2$. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.
