These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to $T1$ correlated with expression of the p76 $T2$, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R.

Transthyretin ($T1$), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with $T2$ and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation.

We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and $T1$$T2$) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence.

In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of $T1$ and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant $T2$ but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15($T1$$T2$), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells.

CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and $T1$$T2$ and syndecan, but not of cadherins.

The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the $T1$$T2$, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily.
