Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with $T1$$T2$ in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

TNF-dependent recruitment of the protein kinase RIP to the TNF receptor-1 signaling complex. The death domain of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 ($T1$) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation through its interaction with the death domain protein $T2$. Here, we show that TRADD interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that RIP is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by TRADD to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, $T1$$T2$, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

$T1$ induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with $T2$ and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa $T1$$T2$ as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16($T1$), and $T2$(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

New structural and functional aspects of the type I interferon-receptor interaction revealed by comprehensive mutational analysis of the binding interface. Type I interferons bind to two cell surface receptors, ifnar1 and ifnar2, as the first step in the activation of several signal transduction pathways that elicit an anti-viral state and an anti-proliferative response. Here, we quantitatively mapped the complete binding region of ifnar2 on interferon (IFN)alpha2 by 35 individual mutations to alanine and isosteric residues. Of the six "hot-spot" residues identified (Leu-30, Arg-33, Arg-144, Ala-145, Met-148, and Arg-149), four are located on the E-helix, which is located at the center of the binding site flanked by residues on the A-helix and the AB-loop. The contribution of residues of the D-helix, which have been previously implicated in binding, proved to be marginal for the interaction with the extracellular domain of ifnar2. Interestingly, the ifnar2 binding site overlaps the largest continuous hydrophobic patch on IFNalpha2. Thus, hydrophobic interactions seem to play a significant role stabilizing this interaction, with the charged residues contributing toward the rapid association of the complex. Relating the anti-viral and anti-proliferative activity of the various interferon mutants with their affinity toward ifnar2 results in linear function over the whole range of affinities investigated, suggesting that $T1$$T2$ results in linear function over the whole range of affinities investigated, suggesting that ifnar2 binding is the rate-determining step in cellular activation. Dose-time analysis of the anti-viral response revealed that shortening the incubation time of low-level activation cannot be compensated by higher IFN doses. Considering the strict dependence of the cellular response on affinity, these results suggest that for maintaining transcription of IFN-responsive genes over a longer time period, low but continuous signaling through the IFN receptor is essential.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 ($T1$), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that $T2$ directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Enhanced degradation of EGF receptors by a sorting nexin, SNX1. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, sorting nexin-1 (SNX1), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, $T1$ is likely to play a role in sorting $T2$ to lysosomes.

Cdi1, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with Cdk2. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, Cdi1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human Cdc2, Cdk2, and Cdk3, but not with Cdk4. In HeLa cells, $T1$ is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with $T2$. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although $T1$ is thought to interact with the $T2$ receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding $T1$ gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native $T2$ complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The $T1$/Jun and ATF/$T2$ families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

$T1$ and $T2$ involvement in the osteogenic properties of the HeLa cell line. The heterotopically induced ossicles are used in our research on bone tissue. The ossicles are formed in the thigh muscle of BALB/c mice under the influence of injected suspension of 3 x 10(6) HeLa cells. We postulate that the mechanism of bone induction is based on the secretion of bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-4 and BMP-6 by the grafted HeLa cells. This was proved by the use of specific immunohistochemical reaction and Western blots of conditioned culture medium. It seems that HeLa cells secrete BMPs continuously into the culture medium, even without contact with the mice muscle tissue, were induction of bone tissue is observed.

The Cockayne syndrome group A gene encodes a WD repeat protein that interacts with CSB protein and a subunit of RNA polymerase II TFIIH. The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype. CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/Snf. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. $T1$ protein interacts with $T2$ protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH. These observations suggest that the products of the CSA and CSB genes are involved in transcription.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit ($T1$) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for $T2$ dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of $T1$ and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by $T2$ or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Positive inotropic responses mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae. The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle. Isolated trabeculae from human hearts were paced at 1.0 Hz in tissue baths, and changes in isometric contractile force upon exposure to agonist were studied. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and $T1$$T2$ (ET-1) and ET-3 had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae. ET-1 was significantly more potent than ET-3 in both atrial (P < 0.001) and ventricular (P < 0.05) trabeculae. Preincubation with the ET(A) receptor antagonist FR139317 (1 microM) decreased significantly (P < 0.005) the potency of ET- I in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae, without any significant changes in Emax (maximum effect obtained with an agonist). The ET(B) receptor agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae, and the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ 788 (1 microM) almost completely blocked this effect. These results suggest that both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16($T1$$T2$, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/$T1$$T2$/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, $T1$$T2$, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of $T1$ to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF ($T2$) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound $T1$$T2$ with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/$T1$$T2$/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for $T1$$T2$ reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and $T1$$T2$) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and $T1$$T2$ protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated $T1$$T2$ protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

TNF-dependent recruitment of the protein kinase RIP to the TNF receptor-1 signaling complex. The death domain of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 (TNFR1) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that TRADD interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that $T1$ is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by $T2$ to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.

Cdi1, a human G1 and S phase protein phosphatase that associates with Cdk2. We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, $T1$ interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human Cdc2, Cdk2, and $T2$, but not with Cdk4. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned $T1$$T2$-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. $T1$ is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products $T2$ and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human $T1$ protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein $T2$. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show $T1$ binds to and activates CCR1 and $T2$ transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring $T1$$T2$) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a $T1$$T2$-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Interaction of the protein $T1$ with $T2$, as revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system. The heterotrimeric G protein, G alpha i2, transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with G alpha i2 by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length G alpha i2. Four positive colonies were obtained. Two of the four were identified as nucleobindin, a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti-nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus. Nucleobindin has a leucine zipper, EF hands, and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted. The specificity of intehraction between G alpha i2 and nucleobindin was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. Transfection of G alpha i2 and nucleobindin in COS cells increased G alpha i2 expression relative to cells transfected with G alpha i2 and mock vector. Our results indicate that the yeast two-hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G alpha proteins. Nucleobindin appears to represent one of those proteins.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19($T1$) and p27($T2$) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named $T1$$T2$ itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and $T1$$T2$ and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the $T1$ is unable to phosphorylate an $T2$ protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between $T1$ and the calcium effector protein, $T2$ (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component ($T1$) identical in sequence to the $T2$ gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between $T1$ and $T2$.

Characterization of the $T1$ binding proteins RBP1 and $T2$. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor $T1$ blocked by $T2$ gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and $T1$/$T2$ families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/$T1$$T2$/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Efficient interaction of HIV-1 with purified dendritic cells via multiple chemokine coreceptors. HIV-1 actively replicates in dendritic cell (DC)-T cell cocultures, but it has been difficult to demonstrate substantial infection of purified mature DCs. We now find that HIV-1 begins reverse transcription much more efficiently in DCs than T cells, even though T cells have higher levels of CD4 and gp120 binding. DCs isolated from skin or from blood precursors behave similarly. Several M-tropic strains and the T-tropic strain IIIB enter DCs efficiently, as assessed by the progressive formation of the early products of reverse transcription after a 90-min virus pulse at 37 degrees C. However, few late gag-containing sequences are detected, so that active viral replication does not occur. The formation of these early transcripts seems to follow entry of HIV-1, rather than binding of virions that contain viral DNA. Early transcripts are scarce if DCs are exposed to virus on ice for 4 h, or for 90 min at 37 degrees C, conditions which allow virus binding. Also the early transcripts once formed are insensitive to trypsin. The entry of a M-tropic isolates is blocked by the chemokine RANTES, and the entry of IIIB by SDF-1. RANTES interacts with CCR5 and $T1$ with $T2$ receptors. Entry of M-tropic but not T-tropic virus is ablated in DCs from individuals who lack a functional CCR5 receptor. DCs express more CCR5 and CXCR4 mRNA than T cells. Therefore, while HIV-1 does not replicate efficiently in mature DCs, viral entry can be active and can be blocked by chemokines that act on known receptors for M- and T-tropic virus.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein $T1$ interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 ($T2$) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to $T1$ did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to laminin 1, type IV collagen and $T2$, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

Positive inotropic responses mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae. The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle. Isolated trabeculae from human hearts were paced at 1.0 Hz in tissue baths, and changes in isometric contractile force upon exposure to agonist were studied. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and ET-3 had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae. ET-1 was significantly more potent than ET-3 in both atrial (P < 0.001) and ventricular (P < 0.05) trabeculae. Preincubation with the ET(A) receptor antagonist FR139317 (1 microM) decreased significantly (P < 0.005) the potency of ET- I in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae, without any significant changes in Emax (maximum effect obtained with an agonist). The $T1$ agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae, and the $T2$ antagonist BQ 788 (1 microM) almost completely blocked this effect. These results suggest that both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound $T1$$T2$-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

The genetics of host resistance and susceptibility to tuberculosis. The study of human genomics has the potential to aid our understanding of the interindividual and interpopulation differences in susceptibility to tuberculosis. Resistance to infection is affected by the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and destroy the bacilli. Several genes are involved in this process, and two have been the focus of recent interest: the $T1$ (NRAMP1) gene and the genes coding for the $T2$. Susceptibility genes have also been discovered--for example, one on the X chromosome that may explain the increased susceptibility of males to tuberculosis. Studies have also focused on the variations in virulence of the bacillus in both its drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms. These mechanisms must be understood in order to prevent, or combat, the emergence of a virulent, multidrug-resistant form of the bacillus that would be uncontrollable by means of today's treatment strategies.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of $T1$ with RAD52 is mediated by $T2$'s self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and $T1$$T2$(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and $T1$ binding activities of $T2$. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with $T1$$T2$ is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Correlation of two-hybrid affinity data with in vitro measurements. Since their introduction, the interaction trap and other two-hybrid systems have been used to study protein-protein interactions. Despite their general use, little is known about the extent to which the degree of protein interaction determined by two-hybrid approaches parallels the degree of interaction determined by biochemical techniques. In this study, we used a set of lexAop-LEU2 and lexAop-lacZ reporters to calibrate the interaction trap. For the calibration, we used two sets of proteins, the Myc-Max-$T1$$T2$-Mxi1 helix-loop-helix proteins, and wild-type and dimerization-defective versions of the lambda cI repressor. Our results indicate that the strength of interaction as predicted by the two-hybrid approach generally correlates with that determined in vitro, permitting discrimination of high-, intermediate-, and low-affinity interactions, but there was no single reporter for which the amount of gene expression linearly reflected affinity measured in vitro. However, some reporters showed thresholds and only responded to stronger interactions. Finally, some interactions were subject to directionality, and their apparent strength depended on the reporter used. Taken together, our results provide a cautionary framework for interpreting affinities from two-hybrid experiments.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound $T1$$T2$, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors ($T1$, $T2$/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Activation of Raf-1 by 14-3-3 proteins. The protein Raf-1, a key mediator of mitogenesis and differentiation, associates with p21ras (refs 1-3). However, the regulation of the serine/threonine kinase activity of Raf-1 is still not understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified two structurally related proteins that interact with the aminoterminal region of Raf-1. These proteins, $T1$ ($T2$) and 14-3-3 beta (HS1), are members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Expression of 14-3-3 proteins in Xenopus oocytes enhanced Raf-1 activity and promoted Raf-1-dependent oocyte maturation. A dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 blocked the effects of 14-3-3 protein.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein ($T1$) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex ($T2$) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of $T1$ protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of $T2$ to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Enhanced degradation of EGF receptors by a sorting nexin, SNX1. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, sorting nexin-1 (SNX1), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of $T1$$T2$ decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/$T1$ and ATF/$T2$ were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. $T1$, $T2$, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to $T1$ correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 $T2$. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a $T1$$T2$ but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, $T1$ blocks the ability of PCNA to activate $T2$, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Activation of Raf-1 by 14-3-3 proteins. The protein $T1$, a key mediator of mitogenesis and differentiation, associates with $T2$ (refs 1-3). However, the regulation of the serine/threonine kinase activity of Raf-1 is still not understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified two structurally related proteins that interact with the aminoterminal region of Raf-1. These proteins, 14-3-3 zeta (PLA2) and 14-3-3 beta (HS1), are members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Expression of 14-3-3 proteins in Xenopus oocytes enhanced Raf-1 activity and promoted Raf-1-dependent oocyte maturation. A dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 blocked the effects of 14-3-3 protein.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein ($T1$) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component ($T2$) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/$T1$ and ATF/$T2$ families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between $T1$ and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin ($T2$). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16($T1$$T2$(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus $T1$ is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and $T2$, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the $T1$$T2$-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Positive inotropic responses mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae. The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin $T1$ and $T2$ receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle. Isolated trabeculae from human hearts were paced at 1.0 Hz in tissue baths, and changes in isometric contractile force upon exposure to agonist were studied. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and ET-3 had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae. ET-1 was significantly more potent than ET-3 in both atrial (P < 0.001) and ventricular (P < 0.05) trabeculae. Preincubation with the ET(A) receptor antagonist FR139317 (1 microM) decreased significantly (P < 0.005) the potency of ET- I in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae, without any significant changes in Emax (maximum effect obtained with an agonist). The ET(B) receptor agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae, and the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ 788 (1 microM) almost completely blocked this effect. These results suggest that both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart.

Characterization of the $T1$ binding proteins $T2$ and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional $T1$ pocket; and (4) $T2$ specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted $T1$ multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for $T2$ association.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, $T1$$T2$/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

New structural and functional aspects of the type I interferon-receptor interaction revealed by comprehensive mutational analysis of the binding interface. Type I interferons bind to two cell surface receptors, ifnar1 and $T1$$T2$ and ifnar2, as the first step in the activation of several signal transduction pathways that elicit an anti-viral state and an anti-proliferative response. Here, we quantitatively mapped the complete binding region of ifnar2 on interferon (IFN)alpha2 by 35 individual mutations to alanine and isosteric residues. Of the six "hot-spot" residues identified (Leu-30, Arg-33, Arg-144, Ala-145, Met-148, and Arg-149), four are located on the E-helix, which is located at the center of the binding site flanked by residues on the A-helix and the AB-loop. The contribution of residues of the D-helix, which have been previously implicated in binding, proved to be marginal for the interaction with the extracellular domain of ifnar2. Interestingly, the ifnar2 binding site overlaps the largest continuous hydrophobic patch on IFNalpha2. Thus, hydrophobic interactions seem to play a significant role stabilizing this interaction, with the charged residues contributing toward the rapid association of the complex. Relating the anti-viral and anti-proliferative activity of the various interferon mutants with their affinity toward ifnar2 results in linear function over the whole range of affinities investigated, suggesting that ifnar2 binding is the rate-determining step in cellular activation. Dose-time analysis of the anti-viral response revealed that shortening the incubation time of low-level activation cannot be compensated by higher IFN doses. Considering the strict dependence of the cellular response on affinity, these results suggest that for maintaining transcription of IFN-responsive genes over a longer time period, low but continuous signaling through the IFN receptor is essential.

$T1$: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/$T2$ (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the $T1$ $T2$. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57($T1$) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only $T2$ increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound $T1$$T2$ in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human $T1$ protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, $T2$, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors $T1$/Jun and ATF/$T2$ alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor $T1$$T2$ pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 ($T1$, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C ($T2$) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with $T1$$T2$ through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/$T1$ ($T2$) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring $T1$$T2$ dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for $T1$$T2$ that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J.

Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both $T1$$T2$ or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/$T1$$T2$/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, $T1$(INK4d) and p27($T2$) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes.

The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the $T1$/$T2$ and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the $T1$$T2$, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 $T1$$T2$, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the $T1$ (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the $T2$ gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16($T1$$T2$), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Enhanced degradation of EGF receptors by a sorting nexin, SNX1. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, sorting nexin-1 (SNX1), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing the lysosomal targeting code. $T1$ contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of $T2$ decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, $T1$, p53, and $T2$ proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit ($T1$$T2$ (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, $T1$ and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with $T2$. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

$T1$: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with $T2$/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus $T1$ is a cellular oncogene that targets $T2$ and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Activation of Raf-1 by 14-3-3 proteins. The protein Raf-1, a key mediator of mitogenesis and differentiation, associates with p21ras (refs 1-3). However, the regulation of the serine/threonine kinase activity of Raf-1 is still not understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified two structurally related proteins that interact with the aminoterminal region of Raf-1. These proteins, $T1$ (PLA2) and 14-3-3 beta ($T2$), are members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Expression of 14-3-3 proteins in Xenopus oocytes enhanced Raf-1 activity and promoted Raf-1-dependent oocyte maturation. A dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 blocked the effects of 14-3-3 protein.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/$T1$$T2$, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human $T1$ and the $T2$ receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and $T1$/$T2$ families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a $T1$-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component ($T2$) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of $T1$, similar to $T2$, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The $T1$ tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the $T2$ cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with $T1$, RAD51, $T2$, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

$T1$ interacts with protein phosphatases $T2$ and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both $T1$$T2$ in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

TNF-dependent recruitment of the protein kinase RIP to the TNF receptor-1 signaling complex. The death domain of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 (TNFR1) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that $T1$ interacts strongly with $T2$, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that RIP is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by TRADD to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of $T1$ protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor $T2$ (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that $T1$ heterodimerizes with $T2$ and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 $T1$$T2$-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for $T1$$T2$ itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, $T1$ in the lysate complexes with wild-type $T2$, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric $T1$ subunits that cannot bind $T2$. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of $T1$, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and $T2$(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, $T1$), a protein kinase C ($T2$) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and $T1$$T2$/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein $T1$ interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit ($T2$), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound $T1$$T2$, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated $T1$$T2$ alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Characterization of an interaction between $T1$ and the $T2$ by using the two-hybrid system. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type $T1$, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, $T2$, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

TNF-dependent recruitment of the protein kinase RIP to the TNF receptor-1 signaling complex. The death domain of $T1$ ($T2$) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that TRADD interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that RIP is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by TRADD to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that $T1$$T2$ in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to $T1$ did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to laminin 1, $T2$ and fibronectin, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

The splicing factor U2AF35 mediates critical protein-protein interactions in constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing. The splicing factor U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) is a heterodimer with subunits of 65 and 35 kD (U2AF65 and U2AF35). U2AF65 binds specifically to 3' splice sites, but previous studies failed to demonstrate a function for U2AF35. Here, we report that U2AF35 is required for constitutive splicing and also functions as a mediator of enhancer-dependent splicing. Nuclear extracts deficient in U2AF35 were inactive; however, both constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing could be restored by the addition of purified recombinant U2AF35. In vitro protein-RNA interaction studies with pre-mRNAs containing either a constitutive or regulated splicing enhancer revealed that U2AF35 directly mediates interactions between U2AF65 and proteins bound to the enhancers. Thus, $T1$ functions as a bridge between U2AF65 and the enhancer complex to recruit $T2$ to the adjacent intron.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/$T1$ and ATF/$T2$ alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Positive inotropic responses mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae. The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle. Isolated trabeculae from human hearts were paced at 1.0 Hz in tissue baths, and changes in isometric contractile force upon exposure to agonist were studied. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and ET-3 had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae. ET-1 was significantly more potent than ET-3 in both atrial (P < 0.001) and ventricular (P < 0.05) trabeculae. Preincubation with the ET(A) receptor antagonist FR139317 (1 microM) decreased significantly (P < 0.005) the potency of ET- I in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae, without any significant changes in Emax (maximum effect obtained with an agonist). The ET(B) receptor agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae, and the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ 788 (1 microM) almost completely blocked this effect. These results suggest that both $T1$ and $T2$ receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and $T1$$T2$, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and $T1$($T2$) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. $T1$ and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB ($T2$) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show $T1$ binds to and activates $T2$ and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 ($T1$, B-50, F1), a $T2$ (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of $T1$: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for $T2$. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a $T1$-related complex ($T2$) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16($T1$$T2$(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit ($T1$) of $T2$ reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. $T1$ was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of $T2$ and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to CD9 did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to laminin 1, type IV collagen and fibronectin, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

TNF-dependent recruitment of the protein kinase RIP to the TNF receptor-1 signaling complex. The death domain of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 (TNFR1) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that TRADD interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that RIP is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by $T1$ to $T2$ in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.

These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to $T1$ correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the $T2$ IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and $T1$($T2$) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound $T1$$T2$ delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated $T1$, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein $T2$. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and $T1$$T2$ and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that $T1$, RPB5, and $T2$ each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Presenilins interact with Rab11, a small GTPase involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. Presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations account for the majority of early-onset dominant cases of familial Alzheimer's disease. Presenilins (PSs) are located in many intra-cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, nuclear region and vesicular structures. These proteins include from seven to nine putative transmembrane domains, with the N- and C-terminal ends and a large hydrophilic loop orientated towards the cytoplasm. We report an interaction between the human PS1 or PS2 hydrophilic loop and Rab11, a small GTPase belonging to the Ras-related superfamily. Interaction domains were mapped to codons 374-400 for $T1$ and to codons 106-179 for $T2$, a region including the fourth GTP-binding domain. Considering the implication of Rab proteins in vesicular transport pathways, the PS-Rab11 inter-action suggests that PSs might be involved in amyloid precursor protein vesicular routing.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of $T1$, hsp90, and $T2$ in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors $T1$/Jun and $T2$/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 $T1$$T2$-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system. Insulin receptor substrate 1 ($T1$) is a major substrate of the $T2$ and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound $T1$$T2$ bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21($T1$), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57($T2$) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, $T1$), a $T2$ (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF ($T1$$T2$ pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human $T1$$T2$-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the $T1$ and $T2$ intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Enhanced degradation of EGF receptors by a sorting nexin, SNX1. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, sorting nexin-1 (SNX1), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of $T1$$T2$ contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the $T1$ (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of $T2$ and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to CD9 did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to laminin 1, $T1$ and $T2$, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the $T1$ $T2$, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor.

Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16($T1$$T2$(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

TNF-dependent recruitment of the protein kinase RIP to the TNF receptor-1 signaling complex. The death domain of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 ($T1$) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and $T2$ activation through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that TRADD interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that RIP is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by TRADD to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and $T1$$T2$/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/$T1$$T2$/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human $T1$ and the $T2$. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of $T1$ dimers for the $T2$ tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with $T1$$T2$ delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

The splicing factor U2AF35 mediates critical protein-protein interactions in constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing. The splicing factor U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) is a heterodimer with subunits of 65 and 35 kD (U2AF65 and U2AF35). U2AF65 binds specifically to 3' splice sites, but previous studies failed to demonstrate a function for U2AF35. Here, we report that U2AF35 is required for constitutive splicing and also functions as a mediator of enhancer-dependent splicing. Nuclear extracts deficient in U2AF35 were inactive; however, both constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing could be restored by the addition of purified recombinant U2AF35. In vitro protein-RNA interaction studies with pre-mRNAs containing either a constitutive or regulated splicing enhancer revealed that U2AF35 directly mediates interactions between $T1$$T2$ directly mediates interactions between U2AF65 and proteins bound to the enhancers. Thus, U2AF35 functions as a bridge between U2AF65 and the enhancer complex to recruit U2AF65 to the adjacent intron.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound $T1$$T2$-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Interaction of transthyretin with amyloid beta-protein: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. $T1$ (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with $T2$ and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that A beta binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of A beta aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains $T1$, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for $T2$ association.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with $T1$/APO-1 ($T2$) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of $T1$, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57($T2$) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 $T1$$T2$ IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Association of terminal complement proteins in solution and modulation by suramin. The association of terminal complement proteins was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation and multi-angle laser light scattering. Native $T1$ and $T2$ formed a heterodimer in solution of physiological ionic strength with a free-energy change DeltaG degrees of -8.3 kcal/mol and a dissociation constant Kd of 0.6 microM (at 20 degrees C) that was ionic strength- and temperature-dependent. A van't Hoff plot of the change in Kd was linear between 10 and 37 degrees C and yielded values of DeltaH degrees = -12.9 kcal/mol and DeltaS degrees = -15.9 cal mol-1 deg-1, suggesting that electrostatic forces play a prominent role in the interaction of C8 with C9. Native C8 also formed a heterodimer with C5,and low concentrations of polyionic ligands such as protamine and suramin inhibited the interaction. Suramin induced high-affinity trimerization of C8 (Kd = 0.10 microM at 20 degrees C) and dimerization of C9 (Kd = 0.86 microM at 20 degrees C). Suramin-induced C8 oligomerization may be the primary reason for the drug's ability to prevent complement-mediated hemolysis. Analysis of sedimentation equilibria and also of the fluorescence enhancement of suramin when bound to protein provided evidence for two suramin-binding sites on each C9 and three on each C8 in the oligomers. Oligomerization could be reversed by high suramin concentrations, but 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6- trisulfonate (ANTS2- ), which mimics half a suramin molecule, could not compete with suramin binding and oligomerization suggesting that the drug also binds nonionically to the proteins.

The genetics of host resistance and susceptibility to tuberculosis. The study of human genomics has the potential to aid our understanding of the interindividual and interpopulation differences in susceptibility to tuberculosis. Resistance to infection is affected by the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and destroy the bacilli. Several genes are involved in this process, and two have been the focus of recent interest: the $T1$ ($T2$) gene and the genes coding for the vitamin D receptor. Susceptibility genes have also been discovered--for example, one on the X chromosome that may explain the increased susceptibility of males to tuberculosis. Studies have also focused on the variations in virulence of the bacillus in both its drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms. These mechanisms must be understood in order to prevent, or combat, the emergence of a virulent, multidrug-resistant form of the bacillus that would be uncontrollable by means of today's treatment strategies.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound $T1$$T2$ with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and $T1$$T2$ substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, $T1$, $T2$, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

BMP-4 and BMP-6 involvement in the osteogenic properties of the HeLa cell line. The heterotopically induced ossicles are used in our research on bone tissue. The ossicles are formed in the thigh muscle of BALB/c mice under the influence of injected suspension of 3 x 10(6) HeLa cells. We postulate that the mechanism of bone induction is based on the secretion of bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-4 and $T1$$T2$ and BMP-6 by the grafted HeLa cells. This was proved by the use of specific immunohistochemical reaction and Western blots of conditioned culture medium. It seems that HeLa cells secrete BMPs continuously into the culture medium, even without contact with the mice muscle tissue, were induction of bone tissue is observed.

Presenilins interact with Rab11, a small GTPase involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. Presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations account for the majority of early-onset dominant cases of familial Alzheimer's disease. Presenilins (PSs) are located in many intra-cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, nuclear region and vesicular structures. These proteins include from seven to nine putative transmembrane domains, with the N- and C-terminal ends and a large hydrophilic loop orientated towards the cytoplasm. We report an interaction between the human PS1 or $T1$ hydrophilic loop and $T2$, a small GTPase belonging to the Ras-related superfamily. Interaction domains were mapped to codons 374-400 for PS1 and to codons 106-179 for Rab11, a region including the fourth GTP-binding domain. Considering the implication of Rab proteins in vesicular transport pathways, the PS-Rab11 inter-action suggests that PSs might be involved in amyloid precursor protein vesicular routing.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant $T1$ monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type $T2$ dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, $T1$, F1), a protein kinase C ($T2$) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 $T1$$T2$ IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the $T1$/Jun and ATF/$T2$ families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of $T1$$T2$ gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, $T1$($T2$) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Crystal structure of human platelet-derived growth factor BB. The crystal structure of the homodimeric BB isoform of human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor ($T1$$T2$ (PDGF-BB) has been determined by X-ray analysis to 3.0 A resolution. The polypeptide chain is folded into two highly twisted antiparallel pairs of beta-strands and contains an unusual knotted arrangement of three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Dimerization leads to the clustering of three surface loops at each end of the elongated dimer, which most probably form the receptor recognition sites.

Enhanced degradation of $T1$ receptors by a sorting nexin, $T2$. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, sorting nexin-1 (SNX1), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes.

The Cockayne syndrome group A gene encodes a WD repeat protein that interacts with CSB protein and a subunit of RNA polymerase II TFIIH. The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype. CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/Snf. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. $T1$ protein interacts with CSB protein and with $T2$ protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH. These observations suggest that the products of the CSA and CSB genes are involved in transcription.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, $T1$$T2$, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/$T1$ and ATF/$T2$ families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. $T1$ also interacts weakly with the $T2$ tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, $T1$ in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, $T2$, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein ($T1$) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the $T2$ gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. $T1$ is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and $T2$. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that myogenin heterodimerizes with E12 and E47 in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and $T1$$T2$ is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound $T1$$T2$ IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, $T1$$T2$ protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, $T1$$T2$/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to $T1$ did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to $T2$, type IV collagen and fibronectin, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and $T1$$T2$ and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Positive inotropic responses mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae. The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle. Isolated trabeculae from human hearts were paced at 1.0 Hz in tissue baths, and changes in isometric contractile force upon exposure to agonist were studied. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and ET-3 had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae. $T1$ was significantly more potent than $T2$ in both atrial (P < 0.001) and ventricular (P < 0.05) trabeculae. Preincubation with the ET(A) receptor antagonist FR139317 (1 microM) decreased significantly (P < 0.005) the potency of ET- I in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae, without any significant changes in Emax (maximum effect obtained with an agonist). The ET(B) receptor agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae, and the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ 788 (1 microM) almost completely blocked this effect. These results suggest that both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of $T1$: $T2$ itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

TNF-dependent recruitment of the protein kinase $T1$ to the $T2$ signaling complex. The death domain of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 (TNFR1) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that TRADD interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that RIP is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by TRADD to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and $T1$($T2$) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted $T1$ multiprotein complex contains $T2$, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a $T1$-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of $T2$ and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Analysis of the oligomerization of myogenin and E2A products in vivo using a two-hybrid assay system. Members of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo- and heterodimers. Myogenin is a muscle-specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins, such as the E2A gene products E12 and E47. We describe a method for detection of protein-protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of VP-16 linked to another. We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin's ability to dimerize. The results show that $T1$ heterodimerizes with E12 and $T2$ in vivo, but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent. Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products c-Jun, v-Fos, and c-Myc, inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.

In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the $T1$ and p76 $T2$ have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound $T1$$T2$ and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the $T1$ ($T2$) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), $T1$$T2$), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both $T1$$T2$ substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

$T1$ interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and $T2$ and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As $T1$ forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated $T2$ expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to CD9 did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to laminin 1, type IV collagen and fibronectin, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

Positive inotropic responses mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae. The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle. Isolated trabeculae from human hearts were paced at 1.0 Hz in tissue baths, and changes in isometric contractile force upon exposure to agonist were studied. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and ET-3 had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae. ET-1 was significantly more potent than ET-3 in both atrial (P < 0.001) and ventricular (P < 0.05) trabeculae. Preincubation with the $T1$ antagonist FR139317 (1 microM) decreased significantly (P < 0.005) the potency of $T2$ in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae, without any significant changes in Emax (maximum effect obtained with an agonist). The ET(B) receptor agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae, and the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ 788 (1 microM) almost completely blocked this effect. These results suggest that both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart.

Activation of Raf-1 by 14-3-3 proteins. The protein Raf-1, a key mediator of mitogenesis and differentiation, associates with p21ras (refs 1-3). However, the regulation of the serine/threonine kinase activity of Raf-1 is still not understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified two structurally related proteins that interact with the aminoterminal region of Raf-1. These proteins, 14-3-3 zeta ($T1$) and $T2$ (HS1), are members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Expression of 14-3-3 proteins in Xenopus oocytes enhanced Raf-1 activity and promoted Raf-1-dependent oocyte maturation. A dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 blocked the effects of 14-3-3 protein.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, $T1$(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57($T2$) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15($T1$$T2$(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Association of terminal complement proteins in solution and modulation by suramin. The association of terminal complement proteins was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation and multi-angle laser light scattering. Native C8 and C9 formed a heterodimer in solution of physiological ionic strength with a free-energy change DeltaG degrees of -8.3 kcal/mol and a dissociation constant Kd of 0.6 microM (at 20 degrees C) that was ionic strength- and temperature-dependent. A van't Hoff plot of the change in Kd was linear between 10 and 37 degrees C and yielded values of DeltaH degrees = -12.9 kcal/mol and DeltaS degrees = -15.9 cal mol-1 deg-1, suggesting that electrostatic forces play a prominent role in the interaction of C8 with C9. Native $T1$ also formed a heterodimer with $T2$,and low concentrations of polyionic ligands such as protamine and suramin inhibited the interaction. Suramin induced high-affinity trimerization of C8 (Kd = 0.10 microM at 20 degrees C) and dimerization of C9 (Kd = 0.86 microM at 20 degrees C). Suramin-induced C8 oligomerization may be the primary reason for the drug's ability to prevent complement-mediated hemolysis. Analysis of sedimentation equilibria and also of the fluorescence enhancement of suramin when bound to protein provided evidence for two suramin-binding sites on each C9 and three on each C8 in the oligomers. Oligomerization could be reversed by high suramin concentrations, but 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6- trisulfonate (ANTS2- ), which mimics half a suramin molecule, could not compete with suramin binding and oligomerization suggesting that the drug also binds nonionically to the proteins.

The genetics of host resistance and susceptibility to tuberculosis. The study of human genomics has the potential to aid our understanding of the interindividual and interpopulation differences in susceptibility to tuberculosis. Resistance to infection is affected by the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and destroy the bacilli. Several genes are involved in this process, and two have been the focus of recent interest: the natural resistance-associated protein (NRAMP1) gene and the genes coding for the $T1$$T2$) gene and the genes coding for the vitamin D receptor. Susceptibility genes have also been discovered--for example, one on the X chromosome that may explain the increased susceptibility of males to tuberculosis. Studies have also focused on the variations in virulence of the bacillus in both its drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms. These mechanisms must be understood in order to prevent, or combat, the emergence of a virulent, multidrug-resistant form of the bacillus that would be uncontrollable by means of today's treatment strategies.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of $T1$ protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF ($T2$) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding $T1$ gamma and $T2$ delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and $T1$$T2$-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or $T1$$T2$ or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that $T1$ forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the $T2$ when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

Associations of $T1$ with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and $T2$ proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type $T1$, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with $T2$. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. $T1$, cyclin D, $T2$(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring $T1$$T2$ reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

New structural and functional aspects of the type I interferon-receptor interaction revealed by comprehensive mutational analysis of the binding interface. Type I interferons bind to two cell surface receptors, ifnar1 and ifnar2, as the first step in the activation of several signal transduction pathways that elicit an anti-viral state and an anti-proliferative response. Here, we quantitatively mapped the complete binding region of $T1$ on $T2$ by 35 individual mutations to alanine and isosteric residues. Of the six "hot-spot" residues identified (Leu-30, Arg-33, Arg-144, Ala-145, Met-148, and Arg-149), four are located on the E-helix, which is located at the center of the binding site flanked by residues on the A-helix and the AB-loop. The contribution of residues of the D-helix, which have been previously implicated in binding, proved to be marginal for the interaction with the extracellular domain of ifnar2. Interestingly, the ifnar2 binding site overlaps the largest continuous hydrophobic patch on IFNalpha2. Thus, hydrophobic interactions seem to play a significant role stabilizing this interaction, with the charged residues contributing toward the rapid association of the complex. Relating the anti-viral and anti-proliferative activity of the various interferon mutants with their affinity toward ifnar2 results in linear function over the whole range of affinities investigated, suggesting that ifnar2 binding is the rate-determining step in cellular activation. Dose-time analysis of the anti-viral response revealed that shortening the incubation time of low-level activation cannot be compensated by higher IFN doses. Considering the strict dependence of the cellular response on affinity, these results suggest that for maintaining transcription of IFN-responsive genes over a longer time period, low but continuous signaling through the IFN receptor is essential.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound $T1$$T2$-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein $T1$ interacted with protein $T2$ (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the $T1$/Jun and $T2$/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of $T1$ and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, $T2$ was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to CD9 did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to laminin 1, type IV collagen and fibronectin, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein ($T1$) has been used here to form complexes between the $T2$ tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21($T1$), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and $T2$(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind $T1$$T2$ dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable $T1$$T2$ delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Activation of Raf-1 by 14-3-3 proteins. The protein Raf-1, a key mediator of mitogenesis and differentiation, associates with p21ras (refs 1-3). However, the regulation of the serine/threonine kinase activity of Raf-1 is still not understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified two structurally related proteins that interact with the aminoterminal region of Raf-1. These proteins, 14-3-3 zeta (PLA2) and 14-3-3 beta (HS1), are members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Expression of 14-3-3 proteins in Xenopus oocytes enhanced $T1$ activity and promoted $T2$-dependent oocyte maturation. A dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 blocked the effects of 14-3-3 protein.

Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system. $T1$ (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the $T2$ and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, $T1$, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and $T2$ forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of $T1$ to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) $T2$ specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and $T1$$T2$ and TFIIB.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated $T1$, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, $T2$, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, $T1$, F1), a $T2$ (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Correlation of two-hybrid affinity data with in vitro measurements. Since their introduction, the interaction trap and other two-hybrid systems have been used to study protein-protein interactions. Despite their general use, little is known about the extent to which the degree of protein interaction determined by two-hybrid approaches parallels the degree of interaction determined by biochemical techniques. In this study, we used a set of lexAop-LEU2 and lexAop-lacZ reporters to calibrate the interaction trap. For the calibration, we used two sets of proteins, the $T1$-$T2$-Mxi1 helix-loop-helix proteins, and wild-type and dimerization-defective versions of the lambda cI repressor. Our results indicate that the strength of interaction as predicted by the two-hybrid approach generally correlates with that determined in vitro, permitting discrimination of high-, intermediate-, and low-affinity interactions, but there was no single reporter for which the amount of gene expression linearly reflected affinity measured in vitro. However, some reporters showed thresholds and only responded to stronger interactions. Finally, some interactions were subject to directionality, and their apparent strength depended on the reporter used. Taken together, our results provide a cautionary framework for interpreting affinities from two-hybrid experiments.

$T1$ induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and $T2$. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

$T1$: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 ($T2$) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the $T1$$T2$, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-$T1$$T2$-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of $T1$ to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional $T2$ pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that $T1$$T2$ or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of $T1$ alone bound $T2$ more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21($T1$$T2$, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta ($T1$$T2$ (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, $T1$$T2$, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Positive inotropic responses mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae. The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle. Isolated trabeculae from human hearts were paced at 1.0 Hz in tissue baths, and changes in isometric contractile force upon exposure to agonist were studied. Endothelin-1 ($T1$$T2$ (ET-1) and ET-3 had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae. ET-1 was significantly more potent than ET-3 in both atrial (P < 0.001) and ventricular (P < 0.05) trabeculae. Preincubation with the ET(A) receptor antagonist FR139317 (1 microM) decreased significantly (P < 0.005) the potency of ET- I in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae, without any significant changes in Emax (maximum effect obtained with an agonist). The ET(B) receptor agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae, and the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ 788 (1 microM) almost completely blocked this effect. These results suggest that both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart.

HOX11 interacts with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 and disrupts a G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint. Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein $T1$ interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as $T2$ (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.

Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with $T1$, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component ($T2$) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Activity of RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF blocked by Rb gene product. The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor $T1$ ($T2$) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.

Activation of Raf-1 by 14-3-3 proteins. The protein Raf-1, a key mediator of mitogenesis and differentiation, associates with p21ras (refs 1-3). However, the regulation of the serine/threonine kinase activity of Raf-1 is still not understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified two structurally related proteins that interact with the aminoterminal region of Raf-1. These proteins, $T1$ (PLA2) and $T2$ (HS1), are members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Expression of 14-3-3 proteins in Xenopus oocytes enhanced Raf-1 activity and promoted Raf-1-dependent oocyte maturation. A dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 blocked the effects of 14-3-3 protein.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, $T1$$T2$, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

New structural and functional aspects of the type I interferon-receptor interaction revealed by comprehensive mutational analysis of the binding interface. Type I interferons bind to two cell surface receptors, ifnar1 and ifnar2, as the first step in the activation of several signal transduction pathways that elicit an anti-viral state and an anti-proliferative response. Here, we quantitatively mapped the complete binding region of ifnar2 on interferon (IFN)alpha2 by 35 individual mutations to alanine and isosteric residues. Of the six "hot-spot" residues identified (Leu-30, Arg-33, Arg-144, Ala-145, Met-148, and Arg-149), four are located on the E-helix, which is located at the center of the binding site flanked by residues on the A-helix and the AB-loop. The contribution of residues of the D-helix, which have been previously implicated in binding, proved to be marginal for the interaction with the extracellular domain of ifnar2. Interestingly, the $T1$ binding site overlaps the largest continuous hydrophobic patch on $T2$. Thus, hydrophobic interactions seem to play a significant role stabilizing this interaction, with the charged residues contributing toward the rapid association of the complex. Relating the anti-viral and anti-proliferative activity of the various interferon mutants with their affinity toward ifnar2 results in linear function over the whole range of affinities investigated, suggesting that ifnar2 binding is the rate-determining step in cellular activation. Dose-time analysis of the anti-viral response revealed that shortening the incubation time of low-level activation cannot be compensated by higher IFN doses. Considering the strict dependence of the cellular response on affinity, these results suggest that for maintaining transcription of IFN-responsive genes over a longer time period, low but continuous signaling through the IFN receptor is essential.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and syndecan, but not of cadherins. $T1$ was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of $T2$ also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to CD9 did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to laminin 1, type IV collagen and fibronectin, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to $T1$ ($T2$) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to $T1$ correlated with expression of the $T2$ IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system. $T1$ ($T2$) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted $T1$-$T2$ complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

Correlation of two-hybrid affinity data with in vitro measurements. Since their introduction, the interaction trap and other two-hybrid systems have been used to study protein-protein interactions. Despite their general use, little is known about the extent to which the degree of protein interaction determined by two-hybrid approaches parallels the degree of interaction determined by biochemical techniques. In this study, we used a set of lexAop-LEU2 and lexAop-lacZ reporters to calibrate the interaction trap. For the calibration, we used two sets of proteins, the $T1$-Max-$T2$ helix-loop-helix proteins, and wild-type and dimerization-defective versions of the lambda cI repressor. Our results indicate that the strength of interaction as predicted by the two-hybrid approach generally correlates with that determined in vitro, permitting discrimination of high-, intermediate-, and low-affinity interactions, but there was no single reporter for which the amount of gene expression linearly reflected affinity measured in vitro. However, some reporters showed thresholds and only responded to stronger interactions. Finally, some interactions were subject to directionality, and their apparent strength depended on the reporter used. Taken together, our results provide a cautionary framework for interpreting affinities from two-hybrid experiments.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/$T1$$T2$, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. $T1$ (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C ($T2$) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Associations of $T1$ with RAD52, UBL1, $T2$, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

Enhanced degradation of $T1$ receptors by a sorting $T2$, SNX1. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, sorting nexin-1 (SNX1), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes.

Interaction of the protein nucleobindin with G alpha i2, as revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system. The heterotrimeric G protein, G alpha i2, transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with G alpha i2 by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length G alpha i2. Four positive colonies were obtained. Two of the four were identified as nucleobindin, a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti-nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus. Nucleobindin has a leucine zipper, EF hands, and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted. The specificity of intehraction between $T1$ and $T2$ was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. Transfection of G alpha i2 and nucleobindin in COS cells increased G alpha i2 expression relative to cells transfected with G alpha i2 and mock vector. Our results indicate that the yeast two-hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G alpha proteins. Nucleobindin appears to represent one of those proteins.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that $T1$ and $T2$ interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 $T1$$T2$ IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/$T1$ and $T2$/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type $T1$$T2$ protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in $T1$$T2$) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of $T1$ (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor ($T2$). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Positive inotropic responses mediated by endothelin $T1$ and $T2$ receptors in human myocardial trabeculae. The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle. Isolated trabeculae from human hearts were paced at 1.0 Hz in tissue baths, and changes in isometric contractile force upon exposure to agonist were studied. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and ET-3 had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae. ET-1 was significantly more potent than ET-3 in both atrial (P < 0.001) and ventricular (P < 0.05) trabeculae. Preincubation with the ET(A) receptor antagonist FR139317 (1 microM) decreased significantly (P < 0.005) the potency of ET- I in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae, without any significant changes in Emax (maximum effect obtained with an agonist). The ET(B) receptor agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae, and the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ 788 (1 microM) almost completely blocked this effect. These results suggest that both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart.

The splicing factor U2AF35 mediates critical protein-protein interactions in constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing. The splicing factor U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) is a heterodimer with subunits of 65 and 35 kD (U2AF65 and U2AF35). $T1$ binds specifically to 3' splice sites, but previous studies failed to demonstrate a function for $T2$. Here, we report that U2AF35 is required for constitutive splicing and also functions as a mediator of enhancer-dependent splicing. Nuclear extracts deficient in U2AF35 were inactive; however, both constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing could be restored by the addition of purified recombinant U2AF35. In vitro protein-RNA interaction studies with pre-mRNAs containing either a constitutive or regulated splicing enhancer revealed that U2AF35 directly mediates interactions between U2AF65 and proteins bound to the enhancers. Thus, U2AF35 functions as a bridge between U2AF65 and the enhancer complex to recruit U2AF65 to the adjacent intron.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the $T1$ ($T2$). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named $T1$, for $T2$. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Endothelin-1 ($T1$) and $T2$ had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae. ET-1 was significantly more potent than ET-3 in both atrial (P < 0.001) and ventricular (P < 0.05) trabeculae. Preincubation with the ET(A) receptor antagonist FR139317 (1 microM) decreased significantly (P < 0.005) the potency of ET- I in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae, without any significant changes in Emax (maximum effect obtained with an agonist). The ET(B) receptor agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae, and the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ 788 (1 microM) almost completely blocked this effect. These results suggest that both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart.

Enhanced degradation of EGF receptors by a sorting nexin, SNX1. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, sorting nexin-1 (SNX1), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the $T1$ ($T2$) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes.

Genetic studies on the role of proteinases and growth factors in atherosclerosis and aneurysm formation. Expression analysis and epidemiologic studies have provided indirect evidence that proteinases and growth factors play a role in the development of atherosclerosis and complications such as aneurysm formation and plaque rupture. Studies using genetically altered mice have proven to be an elegant tool to study the causal involvement of these factors in atherogenesis and to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms. Recently, proteinases of the plasminogen and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) systems as well as their inhibitors have received much attention, and these studies together have emphasized the complexity of their role in vascular disease. This overview summarizes the current knowledge on $T1$ ($T2$) in the progression of atherosclerosis and the influence of MMPs in aneurysm formation. In addition, a possible role for Gas6, the product of growth arrest-specific gene 6, in atherosclerotic lesion development is put into perspective.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with $T1$ ($T2$), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound $T1$$T2$ in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. $T1$ also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of $T2$ corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16($T1$$T2$), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Interaction of transthyretin with amyloid beta-protein: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. Transthyretin (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the $T1$ monomer that interact with $T2$. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that A beta binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of A beta aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

Activation of Raf-1 by 14-3-3 proteins. The protein Raf-1, a key mediator of mitogenesis and differentiation, associates with p21ras (refs 1-3). However, the regulation of the serine/threonine kinase activity of Raf-1 is still not understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified two structurally related proteins that interact with the aminoterminal region of Raf-1. These proteins, 14-3-3 zeta ($T1$) and 14-3-3 beta ($T2$), are members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Expression of 14-3-3 proteins in Xenopus oocytes enhanced Raf-1 activity and promoted Raf-1-dependent oocyte maturation. A dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 blocked the effects of 14-3-3 protein.

The splicing factor U2AF35 mediates critical protein-protein interactions in constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing. The splicing factor U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) is a heterodimer with subunits of 65 and 35 kD (U2AF65 and U2AF35). U2AF65 binds specifically to 3' splice sites, but previous studies failed to demonstrate a function for U2AF35. Here, we report that U2AF35 is required for constitutive splicing and also functions as a mediator of enhancer-dependent splicing. Nuclear extracts deficient in U2AF35 were inactive; however, both constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing could be restored by the addition of purified recombinant U2AF35. In vitro protein-RNA interaction studies with pre-mRNAs containing either a constitutive or regulated splicing enhancer revealed that U2AF35 directly mediates interactions between U2AF65 and proteins bound to the enhancers. Thus, $T1$ functions as a bridge between $T2$ and the enhancer complex to recruit U2AF65 to the adjacent intron.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant $T1$ monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of $T2$ with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. $T1$-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity $T2$, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned $T1$$T2$ is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16($T1$) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only $T2$ increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the $T1$ (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex ($T2$) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the $T1$ and $T2$ forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

The splicing factor U2AF35 mediates critical protein-protein interactions in constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing. The splicing factor U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) is a heterodimer with subunits of 65 and 35 kD (U2AF65 and U2AF35). U2AF65 binds specifically to 3' splice sites, but previous studies failed to demonstrate a function for U2AF35. Here, we report that U2AF35 is required for constitutive splicing and also functions as a mediator of enhancer-dependent splicing. Nuclear extracts deficient in U2AF35 were inactive; however, both constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing could be restored by the addition of purified recombinant U2AF35. In vitro protein-RNA interaction studies with pre-mRNAs containing either a constitutive or regulated splicing enhancer revealed that U2AF35 directly mediates interactions between U2AF65 and proteins bound to the enhancers. Thus, U2AF35 functions as a bridge between $T1$ and the enhancer complex to recruit $T2$ to the adjacent intron.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R.

These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains.

Enhanced degradation of EGF receptors by a sorting nexin, SNX1. The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, $T1$ ($T2$), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to CD9 did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to laminin 1, type IV collagen and fibronectin, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the $T1$ subunit, anti-$T2$ inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that $T1$, $T2$(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of $T1$, $T2$, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

TNF-dependent recruitment of the protein kinase RIP to the TNF receptor-1 signaling complex. The death domain of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 (TNFR1) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that $T1$ interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with $T2$ antigen. We also show that RIP is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by TRADD to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). $T1$ controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas $T2$ functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and $T1$-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by $T2$ or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric $T1$ protein that binds $T2$ approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and $T1$/$T2$ were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor ($T1$$T2$ (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. $T1$ (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a $T2$ (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound CaM more strongly than did intact GAP-43, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase ($T1$$T2$ (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, $T1$, $T2$/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

TNF-dependent recruitment of the protein kinase RIP to the TNF receptor-1 signaling complex. The death domain of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 (TNFR1) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that TRADD interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that RIP is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by TRADD to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact $T1$ protein induces both $T2$ activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of $T1$ and $T2$ in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA. The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during $T1$-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, $T2$ and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the $T1$ tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of $T2$ corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 $T1$$T2$ IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are $T1$-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 ($T2$), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, $T1$ rapidly associated with the $T2$ complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Interaction of $T1$ with $T2$: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. Transthyretin (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous TTR-A beta complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that A beta binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of A beta aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the $T1$ tyrosine kinase and $T2$. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, pp60c-src, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with hsp90. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 $T1$$T2$ IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Associations of UBE2I with RAD52, UBL1, p53, and RAD51 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast RAD52-dependent pathway is involved in DNA recombination and double-strand break repair. Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 participates in S- and M-phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated $T1$, that interacts with RAD52, $T2$, p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1. These interactions are UBE2I-specific, since another DNA repair-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, RAD6 (UBC2), does not interact with these proteins. The interaction of UBE2I with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region. These results suggest that the RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, p53-mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human UBE2I.

Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for RII beta dimerization and/or anchoring RII beta to the cytoskeleton. In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type $T1$$T2$ approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of $T1$: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named $T2$, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), $T1$$T2$), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although $T1$ is thought to interact with the $T2$, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

Characterization of the retinoblastoma binding proteins RBP1 and RBP2. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and $T1$, cloned originally by their interaction with $T2$. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.

TNF-dependent recruitment of the protein kinase RIP to the TNF receptor-1 signaling complex. The death domain of $T1$ (TNFR1) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and $T2$ activation through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that TRADD interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that RIP is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by TRADD to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.

Association of terminal complement proteins in solution and modulation by suramin. The association of terminal complement proteins was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation and multi-angle laser light scattering. Native C8 and C9 formed a heterodimer in solution of physiological ionic strength with a free-energy change DeltaG degrees of -8.3 kcal/mol and a dissociation constant Kd of 0.6 microM (at 20 degrees C) that was ionic strength- and temperature-dependent. A van't Hoff plot of the change in Kd was linear between 10 and 37 degrees C and yielded values of DeltaH degrees = -12.9 kcal/mol and DeltaS degrees = -15.9 cal mol-1 deg-1, suggesting that electrostatic forces play a prominent role in the interaction of $T1$ with $T2$. Native C8 also formed a heterodimer with C5,and low concentrations of polyionic ligands such as protamine and suramin inhibited the interaction. Suramin induced high-affinity trimerization of C8 (Kd = 0.10 microM at 20 degrees C) and dimerization of C9 (Kd = 0.86 microM at 20 degrees C). Suramin-induced C8 oligomerization may be the primary reason for the drug's ability to prevent complement-mediated hemolysis. Analysis of sedimentation equilibria and also of the fluorescence enhancement of suramin when bound to protein provided evidence for two suramin-binding sites on each C9 and three on each C8 in the oligomers. Oligomerization could be reversed by high suramin concentrations, but 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6- trisulfonate (ANTS2- ), which mimics half a suramin molecule, could not compete with suramin binding and oligomerization suggesting that the drug also binds nonionically to the proteins.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or $T1$$T2$ or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

$T1$: a kinase associated with the $T2$. The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 $T1$, and not with expression of the p90 $T2$. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, $T1$$T2$, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to CD9 did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to $T1$, type IV collagen and $T2$, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

Use of a two-hybrid system to investigate molecular interactions of GAP-43. We used the 'interaction trap' (two-hybrid system) to identify polypeptides that interact with the neuronal phosphoprotein, GAP-43, in an intracellular environment. GAP-43 (neuromodulin, B-50, F1), a protein kinase C (PKC) substrate important for the growth and plasticity of neuronal connections, has been implicated in vitro in several signal transduction pathways. In the yeast-based cloning system, the only strong interaction that was detected between GAP-43 and the calcium effector protein, calmodulin (CaM). PKC phosphorylates GAP-43 on serine 41. When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, the interaction with CaM was blocked. Surprisingly, the N-terminal third of GAP-43 alone bound $T1$ more strongly than did intact $T2$, suggesting that the protein's C-terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with CaM. These results, along with other recent findings, suggest a novel role for the interaction between GAP-43 and CaM.

When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of pelle,a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15($T1$$T2$(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Reconstitution of the multiprotein complex of pp60src, hsp90, and p50 in a cell-free system. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has been used here to form complexes between the pp60src tyrosine kinase and hsp90. Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between hsp90 and a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus pp60v-src, which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form. In addition, hsp90 in the lysate complexes with wild-type pp60v-src, of which only a small portion is normally recovered in cytosol in the native multiprotein complex, and with the cellular homolog, $T1$, which has never been recovered in cytosol in the form of a native multiprotein complex with $T2$. Moreover, the reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted complex also contains the 50-kDa phosphoprotein component of the native pp60v-src multiprotein complex. The native and reconstituted pp60src-hsp90 complexes have similar thermal stability and, like steroid receptor heterocomplexes, they are stabilized by molybdate. As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted pp60src multiprotein complex contains hsp70, which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for hsp90 association.

Efficient interaction of HIV-1 with purified dendritic cells via multiple chemokine coreceptors. HIV-1 actively replicates in dendritic cell (DC)-T cell cocultures, but it has been difficult to demonstrate substantial infection of purified mature DCs. We now find that HIV-1 begins reverse transcription much more efficiently in DCs than T cells, even though T cells have higher levels of CD4 and gp120 binding. DCs isolated from skin or from blood precursors behave similarly. Several M-tropic strains and the T-tropic strain IIIB enter DCs efficiently, as assessed by the progressive formation of the early products of reverse transcription after a 90-min virus pulse at 37 degrees C. However, few late gag-containing sequences are detected, so that active viral replication does not occur. The formation of these early transcripts seems to follow entry of HIV-1, rather than binding of virions that contain viral DNA. Early transcripts are scarce if DCs are exposed to virus on ice for 4 h, or for 90 min at 37 degrees C, conditions which allow virus binding. Also the early transcripts once formed are insensitive to trypsin. The entry of a M-tropic isolates is blocked by the chemokine RANTES, and the entry of IIIB by SDF-1. $T1$ interacts with $T2$ and SDF-1 with CXCR4 receptors. Entry of M-tropic but not T-tropic virus is ablated in DCs from individuals who lack a functional CCR5 receptor. DCs express more CCR5 and CXCR4 mRNA than T cells. Therefore, while HIV-1 does not replicate efficiently in mature DCs, viral entry can be active and can be blocked by chemokines that act on known receptors for M- and T-tropic virus.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the $T1$ (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component ($T2$) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Presenilins interact with Rab11, a small GTPase involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. Presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations account for the majority of early-onset dominant cases of familial Alzheimer's disease. Presenilins (PSs) are located in many intra-cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, nuclear region and vesicular structures. These proteins include from seven to nine putative transmembrane domains, with the N- and C-terminal ends and a large hydrophilic loop orientated towards the cytoplasm. We report an interaction between the human $T1$ or PS2 hydrophilic loop and $T2$, a small GTPase belonging to the Ras-related superfamily. Interaction domains were mapped to codons 374-400 for PS1 and to codons 106-179 for Rab11, a region including the fourth GTP-binding domain. Considering the implication of Rab proteins in vesicular transport pathways, the PS-Rab11 inter-action suggests that PSs might be involved in amyloid precursor protein vesicular routing.

Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB alters DNA binding specificity. The Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes. Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/$T1$ and $T2$/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.

Characterization of a novel high affinity human IL-7 receptor. Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation. Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the $T1$$T2$ IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains. Taken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.

Interaction of transthyretin with amyloid beta-protein: binding and inhibition of amyloid formation. Aggregated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a key component of the amyloid depositions found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta is found in a soluble form. The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles. Transthyretin (TTR), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with A beta and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation. In physiological buffers and CSF, TTR exclusively decreased the level of A beta pentamers. Endogenous $T1$-$T2$ complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation. Using site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modelling, we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the TTR monomer that interact with A beta. Specific TTR immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain. We propose that A beta binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of A beta aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and RPB5 specifically bound to transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that $T1$$T2$ substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to CD9 did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to $T1$, $T2$ and fibronectin, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

RIP: a novel protein containing a death domain that interacts with Fas/APO-1 (CD95) in yeast and causes cell death. Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the $T1$ tumor necrosis factor receptor ($T2$) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and $T1$$T2$) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Cloning of two proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunits (gamma and delta) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the TATA-binding protein. The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of $T1$ and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant $T2$ but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the RNA polymerase II subunit 5. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) transactivates viral and cellular genes through a wide variety of cis-elements. However, the mechanism is still obscure. Our finding that HBx directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that HBx directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150). In this context, we examined the possibility that HBx and RPB5 interact with other general transcription factors. HBx and $T1$ specifically bound to transcription factor IIB ($T2$) in vitro, both of which were detected by either far-Western blotting or the glutathione S-transferase-resin pull-down assay. Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that HBx, RPB5, and TFIIB each has two binding regions for the other two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express HBx demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo. Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB. These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with RPB5 and TFIIB.

Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells. Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15($T1$$T2$), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.

Functional significance of CD9 association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 is a member of the tetraspan (TM4) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis. As CD9 forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour, we investigated CD9 expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes. CD9 was present in all the living layers of the epidermis, whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes. There was extensive co-localisation of CD9 and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell-cell borders of basal keratinocytes; however, in contrast to the integrins, CD9 was not found in focal adhesions. CD9 was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of CD44 and $T1$$T2$ and syndecan, but not of cadherins. CD9 was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1; small amounts of CD9 also co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4. Antibodies to CD9 did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to laminin 1, type IV collagen and fibronectin, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic. Like antibodies to the beta 1 integrin subunit, anti-CD9 inhibited suspension-induced terminal differentiation. These results suggest that CD9 may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation.

Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations. At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors. Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins. Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins. A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins. Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues. The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the $T1$$T2$, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily. In this review, we summarize these and other TNF receptor-associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and apoptosis, two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand.
