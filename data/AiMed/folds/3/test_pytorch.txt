The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human $T1$-associated factor $T2$. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. $T1$ is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, $T2$. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and $T1$$T2$ and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from $T1$$T2$ was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by $T1$ in the presence of $T2$. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A $T1$ fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with $T2$ only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine $T1$$T2$ ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely $T1$ ($T2$), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with $T1$ bind a single $T2$ molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

A histone octamer-like structure within TFIID. The general transcription factor TFIID nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced TFIID recruitment or conformational changes in TFIID-promoter complexes. Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary $T1$ ($T2$), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human TFIID subunits hTAF80, hTAF31 and hTAF20/15. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand ($T1$$T2$ (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8].

Regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters: common notes but different melodies. The activity of biogenic amine and amino acid neurotransmitters is limited by presynaptic and astrocytic Na(+)-dependent transport systems. Their functional importance is underscored by the observation that these transporters are the targets of broad classes of psychotherapeutic agents, including antidepressants and stimulants. Early studies suggested that the activity of these transporters can be fine tuned by a number of different signaling pathways. In the past five years, several groups have provided compelling evidence that changing the cell surface availability of these transporters contributes to this fine tuning. This regulated trafficking can result in rapid (within minutes) increases or decreases in the plasma membrane expression of these transporters and is independent of transcriptional or translational control mechanisms. Many of the same signaling molecules, including protein kinase C (PKC), tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ($T1$$T2$ (P13-K), and protein phosphatase, regulate the transporters for different neurotransmitters. In addition to these classical receptor activated pathways, transporter substrates also regulate activity and cell surface expression of these transporters. In fact, some of the transporters form complexes with signaling molecules. Given the functional and genetic similarities of these transporters, it is not surprising that the same signaling molecules regulate their trafficking, but except for the molecules, the actual effects on individual transporters are remarkably different. It is as if the same musical notes have been rearranged into several different melodies.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. $T1$ ($T2$) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular $T1$$T2$ is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for $T1$$T2$ creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. $T1$ produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against $T2$ immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

$T1$-$T2$ and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Induction of cell migration by matrix metalloprotease-2 cleavage of laminin-5. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of laminin-5 (Ln-5) by matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. $T1$ cleaved the $T2$ subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The $T1$ gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/$T2$ [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that $T1$ can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with $T2$.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from $T1$$T2$ immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human $T1$, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of $T2$ and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters: common notes but different melodies. The activity of biogenic amine and amino acid neurotransmitters is limited by presynaptic and astrocytic Na(+)-dependent transport systems. Their functional importance is underscored by the observation that these transporters are the targets of broad classes of psychotherapeutic agents, including antidepressants and stimulants. Early studies suggested that the activity of these transporters can be fine tuned by a number of different signaling pathways. In the past five years, several groups have provided compelling evidence that changing the cell surface availability of these transporters contributes to this fine tuning. This regulated trafficking can result in rapid (within minutes) increases or decreases in the plasma membrane expression of these transporters and is independent of transcriptional or translational control mechanisms. Many of the same signaling molecules, including $T1$ (PKC), $T2$ (P13-K), and protein phosphatase, regulate the transporters for different neurotransmitters. In addition to these classical receptor activated pathways, transporter substrates also regulate activity and cell surface expression of these transporters. In fact, some of the transporters form complexes with signaling molecules. Given the functional and genetic similarities of these transporters, it is not surprising that the same signaling molecules regulate their trafficking, but except for the molecules, the actual effects on individual transporters are remarkably different. It is as if the same musical notes have been rearranged into several different melodies.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the $T1$ subunit of $T2$ and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein physically associates with Nck through Src homology 3 domains. In the second of a series of experiments designed to identify $T1$-Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding molecules, we report the cloning of SAKAP II ($T2$) from an HL60 cDNA expression library. This molecule has been identified as a cDNA encoding the protein product of WASP, which is mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated a highly specific interaction between the SH3 domains of p47nck and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Furthermore, anti-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein antibodies recognized a protein of 66 kDa by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. In vitro translation studies identified the 66-kDa protein as the protein product of WASP, and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that p66WASP is mainly present in the cytosol fraction, although significant amounts are also present in membrane and nuclear fractions. The main p47nck region implicated in the association with p66WASP was found to be the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, $T1$, and $T2$. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Phosphorylation of c-jun mediated by MAP kinases. The proto-oncogene c-jun is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor family involved in the mediation of nuclear events elicited by extracellular stimuli. The c-jun protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues near the carboxy terminus which are dephosphorylated in response to phorbol esters. Here we identify two serine residues in the amino terminal A1 transactivation domain which are phosphorylated in response to a variety of mitogens, phorbol esters and activated ras. We present evidence that mitogen-activated protein-serine (MAP) kinases (pp54 and pp42/44) specifically phosphorylate these sites and that their phosphorylation positively regulates the transacting activity of c-jun. The $T1$ enzymes pp54 and $T2$/44 are regulated by tyrosine as well as serine/threonine phosphorylation. MAP kinase activation of c-jun may underlie the common stimulation of this transcription factor by mitogens, growth factors and oncogenes.

The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with $T1$$T2$ substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and $T1$$T2$ (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, p67-phox, and p21rac) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of cytochrome b558, p47-phox binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor $T1$$T2$, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; $T1$ induced $T2$-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts.

Platelet-derived growth factor C ($T1$), a novel growth factor that binds to $T2$ and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human $T1$ (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-$T2$ binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of $T1$ to $T2$ induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Induction of cell migration by matrix metalloprotease-2 cleavage of laminin-5. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of $T1$ (Ln-5) by matrix metalloprotease-2 ($T2$) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human $T1$ was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to $T2$. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than $T1$ and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than $T2$ and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, $T1$ (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and $T2$. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated $T1$ at sites different from those phosphorylated by $T2$. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact $T1$, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-$T2$ binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus $T1$$T2$-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor $T1$ is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor ($T2$), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to $T1$ and suggest that $T2$ may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, $T1$, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and $T2$. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

A histone octamer-like structure within TFIID. The general transcription factor TFIID nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced $T1$$T2$ nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced TFIID recruitment or conformational changes in TFIID-promoter complexes. Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human TFIID subunits hTAF80, hTAF31 and hTAF20/15. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with $T1$$T2$ receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. $T1$ is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and $T2$-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

Phosphorylation of c-jun mediated by MAP kinases. The proto-oncogene c-jun is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor family involved in the mediation of nuclear events elicited by extracellular stimuli. The c-jun protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues near the carboxy terminus which are dephosphorylated in response to phorbol esters. Here we identify two serine residues in the amino terminal A1 transactivation domain which are phosphorylated in response to a variety of mitogens, phorbol esters and activated ras. We present evidence that $T1$ ($T2$ and pp42/44) specifically phosphorylate these sites and that their phosphorylation positively regulates the transacting activity of c-jun. The MAP kinase enzymes pp54 and pp42/44 are regulated by tyrosine as well as serine/threonine phosphorylation. MAP kinase activation of c-jun may underlie the common stimulation of this transcription factor by mitogens, growth factors and oncogenes.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to $T1$ is an early step in $T2$ signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters: common notes but different melodies. The activity of biogenic amine and amino acid neurotransmitters is limited by presynaptic and astrocytic Na(+)-dependent transport systems. Their functional importance is underscored by the observation that these transporters are the targets of broad classes of psychotherapeutic agents, including antidepressants and stimulants. Early studies suggested that the activity of these transporters can be fine tuned by a number of different signaling pathways. In the past five years, several groups have provided compelling evidence that changing the cell surface availability of these transporters contributes to this fine tuning. This regulated trafficking can result in rapid (within minutes) increases or decreases in the plasma membrane expression of these transporters and is independent of transcriptional or translational control mechanisms. Many of the same signaling molecules, including protein kinase C (PKC), tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ($T1$$T2$), tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13-K), and protein phosphatase, regulate the transporters for different neurotransmitters. In addition to these classical receptor activated pathways, transporter substrates also regulate activity and cell surface expression of these transporters. In fact, some of the transporters form complexes with signaling molecules. Given the functional and genetic similarities of these transporters, it is not surprising that the same signaling molecules regulate their trafficking, but except for the molecules, the actual effects on individual transporters are remarkably different. It is as if the same musical notes have been rearranged into several different melodies.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and $T1$$T2$, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

TRADD-TRAF2 and $T1$-FADD interactions define two distinct $T2$ signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ( TR6 ) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis . TR6 ( decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) ) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) family . TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma , SW480 . In addition , the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate / ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells . The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region . Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6 , we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation . Here , we demonstrate that $T1$ specifically binds two cellular ligands , LIGHT ( herpes virus entry mediator ( HVEM ) - L ) and Fas ligand ( FasL / $T2$ ) . These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry . TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells . It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor ( LTbetaR ) and HVEM / TR2 receptors . Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM / TR2 and LTbetaR , thereby suppressing LIGHT-mediated HT29 cell death . Thus , TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death .

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand ($T1$), and its human receptor ($T2$), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to $T1$ detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that $T2$ is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

TRADD-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a $T1$$T2$ is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, $T1$ was activated by $T2$ in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and $T1$ was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble $T2$. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins ($T1$$T2$ (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, p67-phox, and p21rac) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of cytochrome b558, p47-phox binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors.

Induction of cell migration by matrix metalloprotease-2 cleavage of laminin-5. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of laminin-5 (Ln-5) by matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on $T1$$T2$ subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. $T1$ is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen $T2$ and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; $T1$ induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased $T2$-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found $T1$ mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected $T2$ protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and $T1$ (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and $T2$. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by $T1$ in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human $T2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein physically associates with Nck through Src homology 3 domains. In the second of a series of experiments designed to identify p47nck-Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding molecules, we report the cloning of SAKAP II (Src A box Nck-associated protein II) from an HL60 cDNA expression library. This molecule has been identified as a cDNA encoding the protein product of WASP, which is mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated a highly specific interaction between the SH3 domains of p47nck and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Furthermore, anti-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein antibodies recognized a protein of 66 kDa by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. In vitro translation studies identified the 66-kDa protein as the protein product of $T1$, and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that $T2$ is mainly present in the cytosol fraction, although significant amounts are also present in membrane and nuclear fractions. The main p47nck region implicated in the association with p66WASP was found to be the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of $T1$ on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/$T2$, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 $T1$ variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single $T2$ molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

TRADD-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a $T1$ mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit $T2$ activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine $T1$$T2$) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, $T1$ and $T2$ (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Differential expression of $T1$ and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired $T2$ expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

$T1$ ($T2$), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the $T1$$T2$, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural $T1$ ligands, $T2$ and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and $T1$$T2$ in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the $T1$$T2$ stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human $T1$ ($T2$) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and granulysin expression by CD3(-) $T1$$T2$ and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs $T1$'s ability to support $T2$-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. $T1$ and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased $T2$-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ( TR6 ) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis . TR6 ( decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) ) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) family . TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma , SW480 . In addition , the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate / ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells . The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region . Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6 , we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation . Here , we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands , LIGHT ( herpes virus entry mediator ( HVEM ) - L ) and Fas ligand ( FasL / CD95L ) . These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry . TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells . It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor ( LTbetaR ) and HVEM / $T1$$T2$ ( LTbetaR ) and HVEM / TR2 receptors . Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM / TR2 and LTbetaR , thereby suppressing LIGHT-mediated HT29 cell death . Thus , TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death .

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase $T1$ activates Raf-1 in a $T2$-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine $T1$ and its specific binding subunit $T2$ form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

A histone octamer-like structure within TFIID. The general transcription factor TFIID nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced TFIID recruitment or conformational changes in TFIID-promoter complexes. Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human TFIID subunits hTAF80, $T1$ and $T2$. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and $T1$ in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor $T2$, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

TRADD-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with $T1$ and FADD, signal transducers that activate $T2$ and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a $T1$$T2$ in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

TRADD-$T1$ and TRADD-$T2$ interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of $T1$$T2$-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the $T1$ protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against $T2$ immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. $T1$ and $T2$ associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, $T1$$T2$, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins ($T1$$T2$) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, p67-phox, and p21rac) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of cytochrome b558, p47-phox binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with $T1$ and inhibits the binding of the natural $T2$ ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

A histone octamer-like structure within TFIID. The general transcription factor TFIID nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced TFIID recruitment or conformational changes in TFIID-promoter complexes. Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human $T1$ subunits $T2$, hTAF31 and hTAF20/15. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein physically associates with Nck through Src homology 3 domains. In the second of a series of experiments designed to identify $T1$-Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding molecules, we report the cloning of $T2$ (Src A box Nck-associated protein II) from an HL60 cDNA expression library. This molecule has been identified as a cDNA encoding the protein product of WASP, which is mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated a highly specific interaction between the SH3 domains of p47nck and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Furthermore, anti-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein antibodies recognized a protein of 66 kDa by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. In vitro translation studies identified the 66-kDa protein as the protein product of WASP, and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that p66WASP is mainly present in the cytosol fraction, although significant amounts are also present in membrane and nuclear fractions. The main p47nck region implicated in the association with p66WASP was found to be the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two $T1$, two $T2$ and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely $T1$ (SRF), which binds to the $T2$ promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, $T1$'s central charged cluster domain is required for binding to $T2$'s activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the $T1$/$T2$, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human $T1$$T2$-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the $T1$$T2$ resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of $T1$ mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of $T2$ transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. $T1$ also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with $T2$ in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to HSP27 and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.

A histone octamer-like structure within TFIID. The general transcription factor TFIID nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced TFIID recruitment or conformational changes in TFIID-promoter complexes. Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human TFIID subunits hTAF80, hTAF31 and $T1$$T2$ subunits hTAF80, hTAF31 and hTAF20/15. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.

$T1$-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct $T2$ signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Phosphorylation of c-jun mediated by MAP kinases. The proto-oncogene c-jun is a component of the $T1$$T2$ is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor family involved in the mediation of nuclear events elicited by extracellular stimuli. The c-jun protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues near the carboxy terminus which are dephosphorylated in response to phorbol esters. Here we identify two serine residues in the amino terminal A1 transactivation domain which are phosphorylated in response to a variety of mitogens, phorbol esters and activated ras. We present evidence that mitogen-activated protein-serine (MAP) kinases (pp54 and pp42/44) specifically phosphorylate these sites and that their phosphorylation positively regulates the transacting activity of c-jun. The MAP kinase enzymes pp54 and pp42/44 are regulated by tyrosine as well as serine/threonine phosphorylation. MAP kinase activation of c-jun may underlie the common stimulation of this transcription factor by mitogens, growth factors and oncogenes.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with $T1$ and another protein, $T2$. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

$T1$-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 $T2$ glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of $T1$ was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by $T2$ to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

TRADD-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that $T1$ directly interacts with $T2$ and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein physically associates with Nck through Src homology 3 domains. In the second of a series of experiments designed to identify p47nck-Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding molecules, we report the cloning of SAKAP II (Src A box Nck-associated protein II) from an HL60 cDNA expression library. This molecule has been identified as a cDNA encoding the protein product of WASP, which is mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated a highly specific interaction between the SH3 domains of p47nck and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Furthermore, anti-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein antibodies recognized a protein of 66 kDa by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. In vitro translation studies identified the 66-kDa protein as the protein product of WASP, and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that p66WASP is mainly present in the cytosol fraction, although significant amounts are also present in membrane and nuclear fractions. The main $T1$ region implicated in the association with $T2$ was found to be the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and $T1$ in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 ($T2$) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than $T1$ and $T2$ on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

Crystal structure of the type-I $T1$$T2$ complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with $T1$ and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, $T2$ and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate $T1$$T2$ cooperate to activate Raf-1.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain ($T1$)/$T2$ complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, $T1$ (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases $T2$ and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/$T1$ and the $T2$.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral $T1$ and human $T2$, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and $T1$$T2$ is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, p67-phox, and p21rac) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of cytochrome b558, p47-phox binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs $T1$'s ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support $T2$-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from $T1$-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate $T2$. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with $T1$$T2$ and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to HSP27 and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.

A histone octamer-like structure within TFIID. The general transcription factor TFIID nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced $T1$ recruitment or conformational changes in $T2$-promoter complexes. Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human TFIID subunits hTAF80, hTAF31 and hTAF20/15. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and $T1$$T2$ (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

TRADD-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that $T1$ directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate $T2$ and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Induction of cell migration by matrix metalloprotease-2 cleavage of laminin-5. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of laminin-5 ($T1$) by $T2$ (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by $T1$$T2$ phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor $T1$, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein $T2$. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. $T1$ has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with $T2$ in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, $T1$, and three additional proteins, p54, $T2$, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, p67-phox, and p21rac) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of $T1$, $T2$ binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of $T1$, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural $T2$ ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Induction of cell migration by matrix metalloprotease-2 cleavage of laminin-5. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of laminin-5 (Ln-5) by matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by $T1$ and the resulting activation of the $T2$ cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified $T1$ complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, $T2$. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in $T1$ when associated with $T2$. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of $T1$ and $T2$ by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

Phosphorylation of c-jun mediated by MAP kinases. The proto-oncogene c-jun is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor family involved in the mediation of nuclear events elicited by extracellular stimuli. The c-jun protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues near the carboxy terminus which are dephosphorylated in response to phorbol esters. Here we identify two serine residues in the amino terminal A1 transactivation domain which are phosphorylated in response to a variety of mitogens, phorbol esters and activated ras. We present evidence that mitogen-activated protein-serine (MAP) kinases (pp54 and pp42/44) specifically phosphorylate these sites and that their phosphorylation positively regulates the transacting activity of c-jun. The MAP kinase enzymes $T1$ and $T2$/44 are regulated by tyrosine as well as serine/threonine phosphorylation. MAP kinase activation of c-jun may underlie the common stimulation of this transcription factor by mitogens, growth factors and oncogenes.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate $T1$ kinase were also found to stimulate $T2$ activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, $T1$$T2$, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

$T1$-TRAF2 and $T2$-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ( TR6 ) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis . TR6 ( decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) ) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) family . TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma , SW480 . In addition , the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate / ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells . The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region . Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6 , we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation . Here , we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands , LIGHT ( herpes virus entry mediator ( HVEM ) - L ) and Fas ligand ( FasL / CD95L ) . These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry . TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells . It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor ( LTbetaR ) and HVEM / TR2 receptors . Our data suggest that $T1$ inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM / TR2 and $T2$ , thereby suppressing LIGHT-mediated HT29 cell death . Thus , TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death .

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of $T1$ with the p85 regulatory subunit of $T2$ (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of $T1$$T2$ was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I $T1$$T2$ (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of $T1$, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and $T2$ (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the $T1$ (TcR zeta)/$T2$ complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of $T1$ and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 ($T2$) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Phosphorylation of c-jun mediated by MAP kinases. The proto-oncogene c-jun is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor family involved in the mediation of nuclear events elicited by extracellular stimuli. The c-jun protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues near the carboxy terminus which are dephosphorylated in response to phorbol esters. Here we identify two serine residues in the amino terminal A1 transactivation domain which are phosphorylated in response to a variety of mitogens, phorbol esters and activated ras. We present evidence that $T1$ (pp54 and pp42/44) specifically phosphorylate these sites and that their phosphorylation positively regulates the transacting activity of $T2$. The MAP kinase enzymes pp54 and pp42/44 are regulated by tyrosine as well as serine/threonine phosphorylation. MAP kinase activation of c-jun may underlie the common stimulation of this transcription factor by mitogens, growth factors and oncogenes.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the $T1$$T2$-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the $T1$$T2$) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of $T1$$T2$ has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, $T1$ was activated by JAK2 in the presence of $T2$. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than $T1$ and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and $T2$ on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor $T1$$T2$ glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet $T1$ to HSP27 and suggest that $T2$ may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, $T1$, and $T2$) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of cytochrome b558, p47-phox binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

TRADD-TRAF2 and $T1$-$T2$ interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

$T1$ physically associates with $T2$ through Src homology 3 domains. In the second of a series of experiments designed to identify p47nck-Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding molecules, we report the cloning of SAKAP II (Src A box Nck-associated protein II) from an HL60 cDNA expression library. This molecule has been identified as a cDNA encoding the protein product of WASP, which is mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated a highly specific interaction between the SH3 domains of p47nck and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Furthermore, anti-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein antibodies recognized a protein of 66 kDa by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. In vitro translation studies identified the 66-kDa protein as the protein product of WASP, and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that p66WASP is mainly present in the cytosol fraction, although significant amounts are also present in membrane and nuclear fractions. The main p47nck region implicated in the association with p66WASP was found to be the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of $T1$ ($T2$) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor $T1$$T2$ and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of $T1$ and its association with the Grb2-$T2$ complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters: common notes but different melodies. The activity of biogenic amine and amino acid neurotransmitters is limited by presynaptic and astrocytic Na(+)-dependent transport systems. Their functional importance is underscored by the observation that these transporters are the targets of broad classes of psychotherapeutic agents, including antidepressants and stimulants. Early studies suggested that the activity of these transporters can be fine tuned by a number of different signaling pathways. In the past five years, several groups have provided compelling evidence that changing the cell surface availability of these transporters contributes to this fine tuning. This regulated trafficking can result in rapid (within minutes) increases or decreases in the plasma membrane expression of these transporters and is independent of transcriptional or translational control mechanisms. Many of the same signaling molecules, including protein kinase C (PKC), $T1$$T2$), tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13-K), and protein phosphatase, regulate the transporters for different neurotransmitters. In addition to these classical receptor activated pathways, transporter substrates also regulate activity and cell surface expression of these transporters. In fact, some of the transporters form complexes with signaling molecules. Given the functional and genetic similarities of these transporters, it is not surprising that the same signaling molecules regulate their trafficking, but except for the molecules, the actual effects on individual transporters are remarkably different. It is as if the same musical notes have been rearranged into several different melodies.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific $T1$-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with $T2$ from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to HSP27 and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and $T1$ associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; $T2$ induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and $T1$$T2$ and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human $T1$ $T2$. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human $T1$, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral $T2$, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate $T1$ through signaling cascades emanating from $T2$ (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/$T1$$T2$, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins ($T1$, $T2$, and p21rac) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of cytochrome b558, p47-phox binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the $T1$$T2$ substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor $T1$ is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the $T2$ promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with $T1$ and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and $T2$ (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. $T1$ is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with $T2$ and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The $T1$ family currently consists of two agonists, $T2$ and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the $T1$$T2$ (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of $T1$$T2$, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from $T1$-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by $T2$ to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for $T1$$T2$ binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Induction of cell migration by matrix metalloprotease-2 cleavage of laminin-5. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of $T1$ (Ln-5) by $T2$ (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

Identification of an 11-kDa $T1$-rapamycin-binding domain within the 289-kDa $T2$ and characterization of a critical serine residue. Complexed with its intracellular receptor, FKBP12, the natural product rapamycin inhibits G1 progression of the cell cycle in a variety of mammalian cell lines and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae. Previously, a mammalian protein that directly associates with FKBP12-rapamycin has been identified and its encoding gene has been cloned from both human (designated FRAP) [Brown, E.J., Albers, M.W., Shin, T.B., Ichikawa, K., Keith, C.T., Lane, W.S. & Schreiber, S.L. (1994) Nature (London) 369, 756-758] and rat (designated RAFT) [Sabatini, D.M., Erdjument-Bromage, H., Lui, M., Tempst, P. & Snyder, S.H. (1994) Cell 78, 35-43]. The full-length FRAP is a 289-kDa protein containing a putative phosphatidylinositol kinase domain. Using an in vitro transcription/translation assay method coupled with proteolysis studies, we have identified an 11-kDa FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain within FRAP. This minimal binding domain lies N-terminal to the kinase domain and spans residues 2025-2114. In addition, we have carried out mutagenesis studies to investigate the role of Ser2035, a potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C within this domain. We now show that the FRAP Ser2035-->Ala mutant displays similar binding affinity when compared with the wild-type protein, whereas all other mutations at this site, including mimics of phosphoserine, abolish binding, presumably due to either unfavorable steric interactions or induced conformational changes.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. $T1$ exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and $T2$ on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

Phosphorylation of c-jun mediated by MAP kinases. The proto-oncogene c-jun is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor family involved in the mediation of nuclear events elicited by extracellular stimuli. The c-jun protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues near the carboxy terminus which are dephosphorylated in response to phorbol esters. Here we identify two serine residues in the amino terminal A1 transactivation domain which are phosphorylated in response to a variety of mitogens, phorbol esters and activated ras. We present evidence that $T1$ (pp54 and $T2$/44) specifically phosphorylate these sites and that their phosphorylation positively regulates the transacting activity of c-jun. The MAP kinase enzymes pp54 and pp42/44 are regulated by tyrosine as well as serine/threonine phosphorylation. MAP kinase activation of c-jun may underlie the common stimulation of this transcription factor by mitogens, growth factors and oncogenes.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ( TR6 ) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis . TR6 ( decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) ) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) family . TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma , SW480 . In addition , the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate / ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells . The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region . Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6 , we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation . Here , we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands , LIGHT ( herpes virus entry mediator ( HVEM ) - L ) and Fas ligand ( FasL / CD95L ) . These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry . TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells . It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor ( LTbetaR ) and $T1$$T2$ receptor ( LTbetaR ) and HVEM / TR2 receptors . Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM / TR2 and LTbetaR , thereby suppressing LIGHT-mediated HT29 cell death . Thus , TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death .

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60.

Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23.

TRADD-$T1$ and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct $T2$ signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of $T1$ and that $T2$'s transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of $T1$ and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor $T2$, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the $T1$$T2$, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with $T1$, in particular with $T2$.

Induction of cell migration by matrix metalloprotease-2 cleavage of laminin-5. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of laminin-5 (Ln-5) by matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. $T1$ cleaved the $T2$ gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two $T1$ and two $T2$ molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by $T1$$T2$ is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to $T1$ homodimers and $T2$/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, $T1$ (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and $T2$ (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or $T1$ to IL1R is an early step in $T2$ signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of $T1$ is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic $T2$ cytokine-binding sites.

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and $T1$ expression by $T2$(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble $T1$ interacts specifically with $T2$ and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein physically associates with Nck through Src homology 3 domains. In the second of a series of experiments designed to identify p47nck-Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding molecules, we report the cloning of $T1$ ($T2$) from an HL60 cDNA expression library. This molecule has been identified as a cDNA encoding the protein product of WASP, which is mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated a highly specific interaction between the SH3 domains of p47nck and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Furthermore, anti-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein antibodies recognized a protein of 66 kDa by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. In vitro translation studies identified the 66-kDa protein as the protein product of WASP, and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that p66WASP is mainly present in the cytosol fraction, although significant amounts are also present in membrane and nuclear fractions. The main p47nck region implicated in the association with p66WASP was found to be the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that $T1$ is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase $T2$ and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

$T1$ stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of $T2$ and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of $T1$, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and $T2$. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to $T1$ and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet $T2$.

A histone octamer-like structure within TFIID. The general transcription factor TFIID nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced TFIID recruitment or conformational changes in TFIID-promoter complexes. Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit ($T1$$T2$ complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human TFIID subunits hTAF80, hTAF31 and hTAF20/15. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, $T1$$T2$ (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, p67-phox, and p21rac) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of cytochrome b558, p47-phox binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase ($T1$$T2$ in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of $T1$ ($T2$) by matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of $T1$ expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of $T2$ expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase ($T1$$T2$-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor $T1$$T2$-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, $T1$, $T2$ (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

$T1$-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor $T2$. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

A histone octamer-like structure within TFIID. The general transcription factor $T1$ nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced TFIID recruitment or conformational changes in $T2$-promoter complexes. Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human TFIID subunits hTAF80, hTAF31 and hTAF20/15. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human $T1$ (IL-6) that activates human $T2$. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

TR6 ( decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) ) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) family . TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma , SW480 . In addition , the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate / ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells . The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region . Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6 , we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation . Here , we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands , LIGHT ( $T1$ ) and Fas ligand ( $T2$ / CD95L ) . These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry . TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells . It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor ( LTbetaR ) and HVEM / TR2 receptors . Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM / TR2 and LTbetaR , thereby suppressing LIGHT-mediated HT29 cell death . Thus , TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death .

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was $T1$, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus $T2$. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/$T1$$T2$ G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of $T1$$T2$ by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of $T1$, $T2$, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and $T1$) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, p67-phox, and $T2$) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of cytochrome b558, p47-phox binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

Induction of cell migration by $T1$ cleavage of $T2$. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of laminin-5 (Ln-5) by matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the $T1$ subunit of TFIIF and that $T2$'s transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of $T1$, $T2$, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that $T1$ is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for $T2$. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with $T1$ to perform START in yeast containing a $T2$ mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, $T1$, $T2$, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two $T1$, two IL-6R alpha and two $T2$ molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the $T1$$T2$.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of $T1$$T2$ immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Phosphorylation of c-jun mediated by MAP kinases. The proto-oncogene c-jun is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor family involved in the mediation of nuclear events elicited by extracellular stimuli. The c-jun protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues near the carboxy terminus which are dephosphorylated in response to phorbol esters. Here we identify two serine residues in the amino terminal A1 transactivation domain which are phosphorylated in response to a variety of mitogens, phorbol esters and activated ras. We present evidence that mitogen-activated protein-serine (MAP) kinases (pp54 and pp42/44) specifically phosphorylate these sites and that their phosphorylation positively regulates the transacting activity of c-jun. The MAP kinase enzymes pp54 and pp42/44 are regulated by tyrosine as well as serine/threonine phosphorylation. $T1$ activation of $T2$ may underlie the common stimulation of this transcription factor by mitogens, growth factors and oncogenes.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble $T1$ interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, $T2$ and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein physically associates with Nck through Src homology 3 domains. In the second of a series of experiments designed to identify p47nck-Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding molecules, we report the cloning of SAKAP II (Src A box Nck-associated protein II) from an HL60 cDNA expression library. This molecule has been identified as a cDNA encoding the protein product of WASP, which is mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated a highly specific interaction between the SH3 domains of $T1$ and $T2$. Furthermore, anti-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein antibodies recognized a protein of 66 kDa by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. In vitro translation studies identified the 66-kDa protein as the protein product of WASP, and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that p66WASP is mainly present in the cytosol fraction, although significant amounts are also present in membrane and nuclear fractions. The main p47nck region implicated in the association with p66WASP was found to be the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain.

Regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters: common notes but different melodies. The activity of biogenic amine and amino acid neurotransmitters is limited by presynaptic and astrocytic Na(+)-dependent transport systems. Their functional importance is underscored by the observation that these transporters are the targets of broad classes of psychotherapeutic agents, including antidepressants and stimulants. Early studies suggested that the activity of these transporters can be fine tuned by a number of different signaling pathways. In the past five years, several groups have provided compelling evidence that changing the cell surface availability of these transporters contributes to this fine tuning. This regulated trafficking can result in rapid (within minutes) increases or decreases in the plasma membrane expression of these transporters and is independent of transcriptional or translational control mechanisms. Many of the same signaling molecules, including $T1$ ($T2$), tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13-K), and protein phosphatase, regulate the transporters for different neurotransmitters. In addition to these classical receptor activated pathways, transporter substrates also regulate activity and cell surface expression of these transporters. In fact, some of the transporters form complexes with signaling molecules. Given the functional and genetic similarities of these transporters, it is not surprising that the same signaling molecules regulate their trafficking, but except for the molecules, the actual effects on individual transporters are remarkably different. It is as if the same musical notes have been rearranged into several different melodies.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of $T1$, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and $T2$-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor ($T1$$T2$ ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. $T1$ is also present in immunoaffinity-purified $T2$ complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases $T1$ and $T2$. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Induction of cell migration by matrix metalloprotease-2 cleavage of laminin-5. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of laminin-5 (Ln-5) by matrix metalloprotease-2 ($T1$$T2$ (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-$T1$$T2$-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Interaction with $T1$ subunit of $T2$ is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. $T1$ and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate $T2$ activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human $T1$ (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral $T2$-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Two distinct and independent sites on $T1$ trigger $T2$ dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits $T1$ and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, p67-phox, and $T2$) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of cytochrome b558, p47-phox binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of $T1$, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by $T2$ to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular $T1$ (25%) and $T2$-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and $T1$$T2$ and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of $T1$-mediated transcription by $T2$ is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5].

The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and $T1$$T2$ and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of $T1$-mediated transcription by $T2$ in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact $T1$, which enhances the complementarity of the viral $T2$-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. $T1$ exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than $T2$ and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between $T1$ and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble $T2$. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve $T1$ ($T2$) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

Regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters: common notes but different melodies. The activity of biogenic amine and amino acid neurotransmitters is limited by presynaptic and astrocytic Na(+)-dependent transport systems. Their functional importance is underscored by the observation that these transporters are the targets of broad classes of psychotherapeutic agents, including antidepressants and stimulants. Early studies suggested that the activity of these transporters can be fine tuned by a number of different signaling pathways. In the past five years, several groups have provided compelling evidence that changing the cell surface availability of these transporters contributes to this fine tuning. This regulated trafficking can result in rapid (within minutes) increases or decreases in the plasma membrane expression of these transporters and is independent of transcriptional or translational control mechanisms. Many of the same signaling molecules, including protein kinase C (PKC), tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ($T1$$T2$ (PKC), tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13-K), and protein phosphatase, regulate the transporters for different neurotransmitters. In addition to these classical receptor activated pathways, transporter substrates also regulate activity and cell surface expression of these transporters. In fact, some of the transporters form complexes with signaling molecules. Given the functional and genetic similarities of these transporters, it is not surprising that the same signaling molecules regulate their trafficking, but except for the molecules, the actual effects on individual transporters are remarkably different. It is as if the same musical notes have been rearranged into several different melodies.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet $T1$ to HSP27 and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet $T2$.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and $T1$ associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-$T2$ and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Genetic characterization of a mammalian protein-protein interaction domain by using a yeast reverse two-hybrid system. Many biological processes rely upon protein-protein interactions. Hence, detailed analysis of these interactions is critical for their understanding. Due to the complexities involved, genetic approaches are often needed. In yeast and phage, genetic characterizations of protein complexes are possible. However, in multicellular organisms, such characterizations are limited by the lack of powerful selection systems. Herein we describe genetic selections that allow single amino acid changes that disrupt protein-protein interactions to be selected from large libraries of randomly generated mutant alleles. The strategy, based on a yeast reverse two-hybrid system, involves a first-step negative selection for mutations that affect interaction, followed by a second-step positive selection for a subset of these mutations that maintain expression of full-length protein (two-step selection). We have selected such mutations in the transcription factor $T1$ that affect its ability to heterodimerize with $T2$. The mutations obtained identified a putative helix in the marked box, a region conserved among E2F family members, as an important determinant for interaction. This two-step selection procedure can be used to characterize any interaction domain that can be tested in the two-hybrid system.

Differential expression of $T1$ and $T2$ by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the $T1$$T2$, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

TRADD-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at $T1$$T2$ signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and $T1$, or $T2$, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. $T1$ ($T2$) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID).

Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of $T1$, hsp70, and three additional proteins, $T2$, p50, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. $T1$ and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-$T2$ and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

TRADD-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and $T1$, signal transducers that activate $T2$ and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of $T1$ on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the $T2$/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Induction of cell migration by matrix metalloprotease-2 cleavage of laminin-5. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of laminin-5 (Ln-5) by matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of $T1$ by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the $T2$ cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that $T1$$T2$ binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and granulysin expression by $T1$$T2$ and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related ($T1$$T2$), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ( TR6 ) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis . TR6 ( decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) ) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) family . TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma , SW480 . In addition , the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate / ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells . The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region . Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6 , we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation . Here , we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands , LIGHT ( herpes virus entry mediator ( HVEM ) - L ) and Fas ligand ( FasL / CD95L ) . These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry . TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells . It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor ( LTbetaR ) and HVEM / $T1$$T2$ triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor ( LTbetaR ) and HVEM / TR2 receptors . Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM / TR2 and LTbetaR , thereby suppressing LIGHT-mediated HT29 cell death . Thus , TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death .

Elimination of false negative results in the two-hybrid system in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The yeast two-hybrid system is finding increased use in the study of interactions between proteins. In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively. Interaction between the two polypeptides reconstitutes function of a transactivator which controls expression of reporters. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, p67-phox, and $T1$$T2$ is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins (p47-phox, p67-phox, and p21rac) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558. This is the first report to demonstrate that two of cytosolic components of cytochrome b558, p47-phox binding to p67-phox each other. We encountered several methodological problems in the two-hybrid system which are the focus of this report.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/$T1$ and the $T2$ receptor.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on $T1$$T2$-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate $T1$ were also found to stimulate $T2$ activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral $T1$ and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral $T2$, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family ($T1$) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to $T2$.

We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and $T1$$T2$ and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

A histone octamer-like structure within TFIID. The general transcription factor TFIID nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced TFIID recruitment or conformational changes in TFIID-promoter complexes. Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary $T1$$T2$ complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human TFIID subunits hTAF80, hTAF31 and hTAF20/15. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the $T1$$T2$) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. $T1$ exhibits greater mitogenic potency than $T2$ and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with $T1$$T2$ stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with $T1$ in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with $T2$ in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to HSP27 and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.

$T1$-TRAF2 and TRADD-$T2$ interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related ($T1$$T2$ ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

In this method, two polypeptides are expressed in yeast as fusion proteins to a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain (bd) and activating domain (ad), respectively.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural $T1$ ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and $T2$ (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate $T1$ were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward $T2$ in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes. Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, $T1$, p50, and $T2$. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.

Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor. We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD ($T1$) to $T2$ homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and granulysin expression by CD3(-) CD16(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed $T1$ at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of $T2$ compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001). Similarly, patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer granulysin-positive NK cells than healthy controls. Meanwhile, a considerable number of the tumor-bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells, and a correlation between impaired granulysin expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed. These findings suggest that the tumor-bearing patients with impaired granulysin expression were in an immunosuppressive state. In conclusion, impaired expression of granulysin by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer, and determination of granulysin expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients.

Differential expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired granulysin expression withprogression of cancer. Granulysin has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with perforin in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of granulysin and perforin by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of perforin and $T1$ expression by CD3(-) $T2$(+) cells in healthy controls. In contrast, cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of granulysin expression ( P<0.005), despite having equally high levels of perforin expression in comparison with healthy controls. The tumor-free patients expressed granulysin at levels similar to healthy controls, while the progressive tumor-bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of granulysin compared to healthy controls ( P<0.0001).

Interaction of IL-2R beta and gamma c chains with Jak1 and Jak3: implications for XSCID and XCID. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with $T1$ and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased $T2$-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-$T1$ immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate $T2$. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

The cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 activates Raf-1 in a p21ras-dependent manner. JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/$T1$$T2$, a member of the Janus kinase superfamily was found to interact functionally with Raf-1, a central component of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Interferon-gamma and several other cytokines that are known to activate JAK2 kinase were also found to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity toward MEK-1 in mammalian cells. In the baculovirus coexpression system, Raf-1 was activated by JAK2 in the presence of p21ras. Under these conditions, a ternary complex of p21ras, JAK2, and Raf-1 was observed. In contrast, in the absence of p21ras, coexpression of JAK2 and Raf-1 resulted in an overall decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity. In addition, JAK2 phosphorylated Raf-1 at sites different from those phosphorylated by pp60v-src. In mammalian cells treated with either erythropoietin or interferon-gamma, a small fraction of Raf-1 coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 in lysates of cells in which JAK2 was activated as judged by its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest that JAK2 and p21ras cooperate to activate Raf-1.

Phosphorylation of c-jun mediated by MAP kinases. The proto-oncogene c-jun is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor family involved in the mediation of nuclear events elicited by extracellular stimuli. The c-jun protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues near the carboxy terminus which are dephosphorylated in response to phorbol esters. Here we identify two serine residues in the amino terminal A1 transactivation domain which are phosphorylated in response to a variety of mitogens, phorbol esters and activated ras. We present evidence that mitogen-activated protein-serine (MAP) kinases ($T1$ and pp42/44) specifically phosphorylate these sites and that their phosphorylation positively regulates the transacting activity of $T2$. The MAP kinase enzymes pp54 and pp42/44 are regulated by tyrosine as well as serine/threonine phosphorylation. MAP kinase activation of c-jun may underlie the common stimulation of this transcription factor by mitogens, growth factors and oncogenes.

Induction of cell migration by matrix metalloprotease-2 cleavage of laminin-5. Structural changes in the extracellular matrix are necessary for cell migration during tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. Specific cleavage of laminin-5 ($T1$) by matrix metalloprotease-2 ($T2$) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 gamma2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling.

TRADD-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that $T1$ directly interacts with TRAF2 and $T2$, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 $T1$ variants complexed with $T2$ bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

CD4-induced interaction of primary HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor CCR-5. For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of $T1$, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with $T2$ and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.

Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor $T1$, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 ($T2$) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.

The retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene product binds directly to the human TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the $T1$ $T2$, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of $T1$ or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in $T2$ signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, $T1$, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and $T2$ (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.
