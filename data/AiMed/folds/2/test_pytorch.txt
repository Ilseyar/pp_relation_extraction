Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for $T1$ can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early $T2$ complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-$T1$ and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on $T2$, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. $T1$/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor $T2$, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

The $T1$ protein binds to $T2$, a zinc-finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus E1A protein. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins, we have searched cDNA libraries for Rb-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein RIZ from rat and human cells. RIZ is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc-finger motifs. It contains an Rb-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of E1A. A domain is conserved between RIZ and the PRDI-BF1/Blimp-1 differentiation factor. Other motifs of RIZ include putative GTPase and SH3 (src homology domain 3) domains. RIZ is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues. It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While the function of RIZ is not yet clear, its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for RIZ in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell $T1$ complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and $T2$. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the $T1$, $T2$, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either $T1$ or $T2$ in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect $T1$$T2$ binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and $T1$$T2$ and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase $T1$ associates with the Src-family kinase p53/$T2$ and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and $T1$$T2$, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core $T1$ present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and $T2$ beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between $T1$ and $T2$, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature $T1$$T2$ complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Crystal structure of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor bound to the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. The crystal structure of the human p27Kip1 kinase inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. p27Kip1 binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and $T1$$T2$ and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

The retinoblastoma protein binds to RIZ, a zinc-finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus $T1$$T2$, a zinc-finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus E1A protein. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins, we have searched cDNA libraries for Rb-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein RIZ from rat and human cells. RIZ is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc-finger motifs. It contains an Rb-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of E1A. A domain is conserved between RIZ and the PRDI-BF1/Blimp-1 differentiation factor. Other motifs of RIZ include putative GTPase and SH3 (src homology domain 3) domains. RIZ is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues. It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While the function of RIZ is not yet clear, its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for RIZ in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma.

Specific activation of cdc25 tyrosine phosphatases by B-type cyclins: evidence for multiple roles of mitotic cyclins. Two previously unidentified human cdc25 genes have been isolated, cdc25A and cdc25B. Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast. Microinjection of anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. cdc25A and cdc25B display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either cyclin B1 or B2 but not A or D1. Association between $T1$ and $T2$/cdc2 was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the cdc2 protein kinase, but also activate the cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase, of which cdc2 is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and $T1$$T2$ and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human $T1$ (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact $T2$, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect $T1$$T2$ binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins $T1$$T2$, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of $T1$ was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or $T2$.

Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the $T1$$T2$-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Specific activation of cdc25 tyrosine phosphatases by B-type cyclins: evidence for multiple roles of mitotic cyclins. Two previously unidentified human cdc25 genes have been isolated, $T1$ and $T2$. Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast. Microinjection of anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. cdc25A and cdc25B display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either cyclin B1 or B2 but not A or D1. Association between cdc25A and cyclin B1/cdc2 was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the cdc2 protein kinase, but also activate the cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase, of which cdc2 is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds $T1$$T2$ receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of $T1$ from fresh platelet lysates to the $T2$ fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to HSP27 and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that $T1$ consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around $T2$ in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Crystal structure of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor bound to the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. The crystal structure of the human $T1$ inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated $T2$-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. p27Kip1 binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four $T1$-anchoring protein sequences (the $T2$, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of $T1$, an alternatively spliced form of d$T2$ (p32).

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the $T1$-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many $T2$ interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular $T1$ as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of $T2$ bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding $T1$ and $T2$ receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Specific activation of cdc25 tyrosine phosphatases by B-type cyclins: evidence for multiple roles of mitotic cyclins. Two previously unidentified human cdc25 genes have been isolated, cdc25A and cdc25B. Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast. Microinjection of anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. $T1$ and cdc25B display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either $T2$ or B2 but not A or D1. Association between cdc25A and cyclin B1/cdc2 was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the cdc2 protein kinase, but also activate the cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase, of which cdc2 is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and $T1$$T2$ cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, $T1$ (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 ($T2$) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three $T1$$T2$ to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-$T1$ associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and $T2$ from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [$T1$ (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes $T2$, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and $T1$$T2$ and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, $T1$$T2$, K5, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

The retinoblastoma protein binds to RIZ, a zinc-finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus E1A protein. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins, we have searched cDNA libraries for Rb-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein RIZ from rat and human cells. RIZ is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc-finger motifs. It contains an Rb-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of E1A. A domain is conserved between RIZ and the $T1$/$T2$ differentiation factor. Other motifs of RIZ include putative GTPase and SH3 (src homology domain 3) domains. RIZ is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues. It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While the function of RIZ is not yet clear, its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for RIZ in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of $T1$ and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes ($T2$) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in $T1$ is the binding site for the $T2$ SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between $T1$ and CDC2, or $T2$, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished $T1$$T2$ binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Specific activation of cdc25 tyrosine phosphatases by B-type cyclins: evidence for multiple roles of mitotic cyclins. Two previously unidentified human cdc25 genes have been isolated, cdc25A and cdc25B. Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast. Microinjection of anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. cdc25A and cdc25B display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either cyclin B1 or B2 but not A or D1. Association between cdc25A and cyclin B1/cdc2 was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the $T1$ protein kinase, but also activate the cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase, of which $T2$ is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. $T1$ also was shown to coprecipitate with $T2$ in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to HSP27 and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-$T1$ interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on $T2$, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. $T1$ mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 ($T2$) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either $T1$ or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of $T2$ or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

The retinoblastoma protein binds to RIZ, a zinc-finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus E1A protein. The $T1$ ($T2$) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins, we have searched cDNA libraries for Rb-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein RIZ from rat and human cells. RIZ is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc-finger motifs. It contains an Rb-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of E1A. A domain is conserved between RIZ and the PRDI-BF1/Blimp-1 differentiation factor. Other motifs of RIZ include putative GTPase and SH3 (src homology domain 3) domains. RIZ is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues. It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While the function of RIZ is not yet clear, its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for RIZ in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain $T1$ (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)$T2$. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with $T1$$T2$ interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

A comparative study of E-cadherin and stromelysin-3 expression in de novo and ex adenoma carcinoma of the colorectum. An apparent exception to the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma carcinogenetic pathway is the so-called "de novo" carcinoma which has no evidence of adenoma in its vicinity. Despite the fact that they are often quite small, these lesions appear to be more aggressive (i.e., greater likelihood of lymph-node metastases) than carcinomas that clearly arise from surrounding adenomas exadenoma carcinoma. The purpose of the present comparative immunohistochemical study was to compare rates of cell adhesion molecule (E-cadherin) and protease [$T1$$T2$) and protease [stromelysin-3 (ST-3)] expression in groups of de novo (n=64) and ex adenoma (n=42) lesions in order to see whether their more aggressive behavior is associated with decreased cell adhesion and increased protease expression. The rates of extensive ST-3 expression and decreased E-cadherin expression were significantly higher in the de novo group (P=0.014 and 0.005, respectively). Histopathologically, the de novo group also had a significantly higher percentage of cases with an infiltrative invasion pattern. These differences highlight the more aggressive phenotype of the de novo colorectal carcinoma and fit with their greater invasive potential.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of $T1$ indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding $T2$ and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Human gastrinoma cells express calcium-sensing receptor. The intravenous calcium injection test has been reported to be useful for the diagnosis of gastrinoma. However, the mechanism underlying calcium-evoked gastrin release is not fully understood. We investigated the mechanism of calcium-stimulated gastrin release from gastrinoma cells in vitro with a particular focus on the $T1$ ($T2$). Human gastrinoma cells were taken from mechanically minced gastrinoma tissues obtained at surgery. In the perifusion system, high [Ca2+]o induced gastrin release from gastrinoma cells. As [Ca2+]o increased, [Ca2+]i rapidly increased, as monitored by fluorometry. The response was not inhibited by nifedipine, a blocker of the voltage-dependent calcium channel. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent Southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of the CaR gene in human gastrinoma tissues. Moreover, the expression of CaR in gastrinoma tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated that CaR was expressed in human gastrinoma cells and could be involved in the mechanism of calcium-evoked gastrin release.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the $T1$$T2$ receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-$T1$ and 125I-$T2$ to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory $T1$ subunit of $T2$ associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Crystal structure of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor bound to the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. The crystal structure of the human p27Kip1 kinase inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-$T1$$T2$-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. p27Kip1 binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which $T1$$T2$/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for $T1$$T2$ to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including $T1$, $T2$, K5, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in $T1$$T2$, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/$T1$$T2$) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since $T1$ and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-$T2$ complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between $T1$$T2$ interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated $T1$, interacts with $T2$ following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with $T1$$T2$ alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, $T1$$T2$ homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both $T1$$T2$ cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with $T1$$T2$ from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa $T1$ (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/$T2$) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min.

The crystal structure of the human p27Kip1 kinase inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. $T1$ binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and $T2$. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and $T1$ do not readily associate on their own, it appears that $T2$ is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various $T1$/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the $T2$ subunit.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein $T1$ ($T2$) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of $T1$ associated with $T2$ in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein $T1$ also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the $T2$. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. $T1$ produced in E. coli bound and activated the $T2$ protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, $T1$, and $T2$. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific $T1$$T2$-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-$T1$ and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for $T2$, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early $T1$ complexes containing hsp70 and Hip ($T2$). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Cloning and characterization of a specific $T1$ binding protein structurally related to the $T2$ alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of $T1$$T2$, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 ($T1$ and $T2$ beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Specific activation of cdc25 tyrosine phosphatases by B-type cyclins: evidence for multiple roles of mitotic cyclins. Two previously unidentified human cdc25 genes have been isolated, $T1$$T2$ genes have been isolated, cdc25A and cdc25B. Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast. Microinjection of anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. cdc25A and cdc25B display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either cyclin B1 or B2 but not A or D1. Association between cdc25A and cyclin B1/cdc2 was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the cdc2 protein kinase, but also activate the cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase, of which cdc2 is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of $T1$ and pp120 to $T2$.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature $T1$ complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early $T2$ complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Th1/Th2 type cytokines in hepatitis B patients treated with interferon-alpha. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the expression of Th1/Th2 type cytokines and the effect of interferon-alpha therapy. METHODS: Th1/Th2 type cytokines were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: Levels of IFN-gamma in the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultures from the patients with hepatitis B were slightly lower than those of controls (P = 0.07). However, the levels of IL-4 were higher than those of controls (P = 0.01). Cytokines measurements during IFN-alpha treatment showed a trend to decreasing levels of IL-4 at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Levels of IFN-gamma were slightly increased following IFN-alpha treatment (P = 0.09). In patients with a complete response to IFN-alpha, the levels of $T1$ were higher at 24 weeks following $T2$ treatment than that of pre-treatment (P = 0.04), and the levels of IL-4 decreased markedly at 12 and 24 weeks (P = 0.02, 0.03, respectively). mRNA expression positively correlated with the level of Th1/Th2 type cytokines in the supernatant. CONCLUSION: The expression of Th2 type cytokines is predominant in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Interferon-alpha therapy can modulate the balance of Th1/Th2 type cytokines, and this is related to its clinical effect. Levels of Th1/Th2 type cytokines could be a predictor of clinical response during Interferon-alpha treatment.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein ($T1$) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the $T2$ receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to $T1$/$T2$. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Biological data and clinical symptoms as predictors of astrogliosis and neurodegeneration in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Concentrations of $T1$ ($T2$) and light subunit neurofilament protein (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Correlations between GFAp and NFL in CSF as markers for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration, and clinical and biological data were investigated. Abnormal levels of GFAp and NFL were significantly associated with increasing CSF cell number and protein concentration, and with the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirate. A significant association was found between abnormal NFL and presence of trypanosomes in CSF, abnormal limb movements, difficulties in gait and coordination, and low Karnofsky index. By multivariate analysis, it was shown that increasing CSF cell number, increasing CSF protein concentration, and the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in the lymph node aspirate were the best predictors for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration among the variables tested. These results demonstrate the importance of CSF cell count and protein determination in assessment of the severity of central nervous system involvement and reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis to assess the stage of the disease. The clinical symptoms studied were less useful in predicting astrogliosis or neurodegeneration.

Potential cellular signatures of viral infections in human hematopoietic cells. Expression profiling of cellular genes was performed using a 10,000 cDNA human gene array in order to identify expression changes following chronic infection of human hematopoietic cells with Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Virus (KSHV) also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and Human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). We performed cell-free in vitro infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells using semi-purified HHV8 and a mature IL-2 dependent T cell line, KIT 225, using highly concentrated viral stocks prepared from an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-1. Thirty days post infection, mRNA was isolated from infected cultures and uninfected controls and submitted for microarray analysis. More than 400 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following HHV8 infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells. Of these 400, interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), $T1$$T2$), cyclin B2, TBP-associated factor, eukaryotic elongation factor and pim 2 were up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. In contrast, less than 100 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following chronic infection of a mature T cell line with HTLV-1. Of these, only cdc7 was up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. These data may provide insight into cellular signatures of infection useful for diagnosis of infection as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four $T1$-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, $T2$, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of $T1$ and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 ($T2$ of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of $T1$ and hsp90 in intermediate $T2$ complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, $T1$ (KDR)/$T2$ (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins $T1$ and $T2$), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

The retinoblastoma protein binds to RIZ, a zinc-finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus E1A protein. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins, we have searched cDNA libraries for Rb-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein RIZ from rat and human cells. RIZ is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc-finger motifs. It contains an Rb-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of E1A. A domain is conserved between $T1$ and the PRDI-BF1/$T2$ differentiation factor. Other motifs of RIZ include putative GTPase and SH3 (src homology domain 3) domains. RIZ is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues. It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While the function of RIZ is not yet clear, its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for RIZ in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma.

Crystal structure of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor bound to the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. The crystal structure of the human p27Kip1 kinase inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. $T1$ binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both $T2$ and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between $T1$ and $T2$ is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the $T1$-calnexin and the GT155-$T2$ interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a $T1$$T2$ and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory $T1$ subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with $T2$ in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. $T1$ ($T2$), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, K5, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core $T1$ present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain $T2$ (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor ($T1$) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing $T2$. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32).

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature $T1$ complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing $T2$ and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Potential cellular signatures of viral infections in human hematopoietic cells. Expression profiling of cellular genes was performed using a 10,000 cDNA human gene array in order to identify expression changes following chronic infection of human hematopoietic cells with Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Virus (KSHV) also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and Human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). We performed cell-free in vitro infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells using semi-purified HHV8 and a mature IL-2 dependent T cell line, KIT 225, using highly concentrated viral stocks prepared from an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-1. Thirty days post infection, mRNA was isolated from infected cultures and uninfected controls and submitted for microarray analysis. More than 400 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following HHV8 infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells. Of these 400, interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), $T1$, TBP-associated factor, eukaryotic elongation factor and $T2$ were up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. In contrast, less than 100 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following chronic infection of a mature T cell line with HTLV-1. Of these, only cdc7 was up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. These data may provide insight into cellular signatures of infection useful for diagnosis of infection as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. $T1$ mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/$T2$ (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, $T1$, and $T2$, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 ($T1$$T2$ and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the $T1$ cDNA bind $T2$ with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase $T1$/56Lyn ($T2$) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of $T1$ and $T2$ complexes.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core $T1$ present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and $T2$ respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP.

Biological data and clinical symptoms as predictors of astrogliosis and neurodegeneration in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) and light subunit neurofilament protein ($T1$$T2$) and light subunit neurofilament protein (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Correlations between GFAp and NFL in CSF as markers for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration, and clinical and biological data were investigated. Abnormal levels of GFAp and NFL were significantly associated with increasing CSF cell number and protein concentration, and with the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirate. A significant association was found between abnormal NFL and presence of trypanosomes in CSF, abnormal limb movements, difficulties in gait and coordination, and low Karnofsky index. By multivariate analysis, it was shown that increasing CSF cell number, increasing CSF protein concentration, and the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in the lymph node aspirate were the best predictors for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration among the variables tested. These results demonstrate the importance of CSF cell count and protein determination in assessment of the severity of central nervous system involvement and reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis to assess the stage of the disease. The clinical symptoms studied were less useful in predicting astrogliosis or neurodegeneration.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. $T1$, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with $T2$ only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that p300 and CBP might be involved in YY1-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between YY1 and p300, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of CREB-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of $T1$-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between $T2$ and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress Sp1- and CREB-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing $T1$ ($T2$), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. $T1$ showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the $T2$ protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in $T1$$T2$ binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which $T1$$T2$, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Potential cellular signatures of viral infections in human hematopoietic cells. Expression profiling of cellular genes was performed using a 10,000 cDNA human gene array in order to identify expression changes following chronic infection of human hematopoietic cells with Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Virus (KSHV) also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and Human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). We performed cell-free in vitro infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells using semi-purified HHV8 and a mature IL-2 dependent T cell line, KIT 225, using highly concentrated viral stocks prepared from an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-1. Thirty days post infection, mRNA was isolated from infected cultures and uninfected controls and submitted for microarray analysis. More than 400 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following HHV8 infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells. Of these 400, interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), $T1$$T2$ (IRF4), cyclin B2, TBP-associated factor, eukaryotic elongation factor and pim 2 were up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. In contrast, less than 100 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following chronic infection of a mature T cell line with HTLV-1. Of these, only cdc7 was up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. These data may provide insight into cellular signatures of infection useful for diagnosis of infection as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with $T1$ resembled the Syk-associated $T2$ by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as $T1$$T2$ and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor $T1$$T2$ and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that $T1$ and $T2$ might be involved in YY1-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between YY1 and p300, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of CREB-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of CTF-1-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between YY1 and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress Sp1- and CREB-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 ($T1$$T2$ (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The $T1$ is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit ($T2$) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter $T1$ is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, $T2$, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), $T1$, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing $T2$ and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and $T1$$T2$ and pp120 to CD5.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for $T1$, suggesting these complexes contain two or three $T2$ molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells.

The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Specific activation of cdc25 tyrosine phosphatases by B-type cyclins: evidence for multiple roles of mitotic cyclins. Two previously unidentified human cdc25 genes have been isolated, cdc25A and cdc25B. Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast. Microinjection of anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. cdc25A and cdc25B display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either cyclin B1 or B2 but not A or D1. Association between cdc25A and $T1$/$T2$ was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the cdc2 protein kinase, but also activate the cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase, of which cdc2 is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and $T1$ coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified $T2$ and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind $T1$$T2$. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. $T1$ mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, $T2$ (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein ($T1$$T2$ (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-$T1$$T2$-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Crystal structure of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor bound to the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. The crystal structure of the human p27Kip1 kinase inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-$T1$ ($T2$) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. p27Kip1 binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

Potential cellular signatures of viral infections in human hematopoietic cells. Expression profiling of cellular genes was performed using a 10,000 cDNA human gene array in order to identify expression changes following chronic infection of human hematopoietic cells with Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Virus (KSHV) also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and Human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). We performed cell-free in vitro infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells using semi-purified HHV8 and a mature IL-2 dependent T cell line, KIT 225, using highly concentrated viral stocks prepared from an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-1. Thirty days post infection, mRNA was isolated from infected cultures and uninfected controls and submitted for microarray analysis. More than 400 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following HHV8 infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells. Of these 400, interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), cyclin B2, TBP-associated factor, eukaryotic elongation factor and $T1$$T2$), cyclin B2, TBP-associated factor, eukaryotic elongation factor and pim 2 were up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. In contrast, less than 100 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following chronic infection of a mature T cell line with HTLV-1. Of these, only cdc7 was up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. These data may provide insight into cellular signatures of infection useful for diagnosis of infection as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that $T1$ and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of $T2$. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or $T1$$T2$ or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since $T1$-$T2$ associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. $T1$ ($T2$) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both $T1$$T2$ cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to HSP27 and suggest that $T1$ may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet $T2$.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that $T1$ and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in $T2$-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-$T1$ and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three $T2$ molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. $T1$ can bind either $T2$ or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/$T1$$T2$) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-$T1$ and the $T2$-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 ($T1$) and $T2$. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, $T1$ interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and $T2$ or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Cloning and characterization of a specific $T1$ binding protein structurally related to the $T2$ receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of $T1$ and pp120 with $T2$. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase $T1$ associates with the Src-family kinase $T2$/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of $T1$-$T2$ binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of $T1$$T2$ and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain $T1$ ($T2$ and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing $T1$ (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing $T2$ and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-$T1$ interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since $T2$-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/$T1$, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with $T2$ binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that p300 and CBP might be involved in YY1-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between YY1 and p300, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of CREB-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of CTF-1-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between YY1 and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress $T1$- and $T2$-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

Biological data and clinical symptoms as predictors of astrogliosis and neurodegeneration in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) and $T1$$T2$) and light subunit neurofilament protein (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Correlations between GFAp and NFL in CSF as markers for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration, and clinical and biological data were investigated. Abnormal levels of GFAp and NFL were significantly associated with increasing CSF cell number and protein concentration, and with the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirate. A significant association was found between abnormal NFL and presence of trypanosomes in CSF, abnormal limb movements, difficulties in gait and coordination, and low Karnofsky index. By multivariate analysis, it was shown that increasing CSF cell number, increasing CSF protein concentration, and the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in the lymph node aspirate were the best predictors for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration among the variables tested. These results demonstrate the importance of CSF cell count and protein determination in assessment of the severity of central nervous system involvement and reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis to assess the stage of the disease. The clinical symptoms studied were less useful in predicting astrogliosis or neurodegeneration.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the $T1$$T2$) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Specific activation of cdc25 tyrosine phosphatases by B-type cyclins: evidence for multiple roles of mitotic cyclins. Two previously unidentified human cdc25 genes have been isolated, cdc25A and cdc25B. Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast. Microinjection of anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. cdc25A and cdc25B display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either cyclin B1 or B2 but not A or D1. Association between cdc25A and cyclin B1/cdc2 was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the cdc2 protein kinase, but also activate the $T1$ tyrosine phosphatase, of which $T2$ is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. $T1$ is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain $T2$ (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein ($T1$) associated with $T2$ and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect $T1$$T2$ site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Association between cdc25A and cyclin B1/cdc2 was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the cdc2 protein kinase, but also activate the cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase, of which cdc2 is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and $T1$$T2$ respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

The retinoblastoma protein binds to RIZ, a zinc-finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus E1A protein. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins, we have searched cDNA libraries for Rb-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein RIZ from rat and human cells. RIZ is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc-finger motifs. It contains an Rb-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of E1A. A domain is conserved between RIZ and the PRDI-BF1/Blimp-1 differentiation factor. Other motifs of RIZ include putative GTPase and SH3 (src homology domain 3) domains. RIZ is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues. It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While the function of $T1$ is not yet clear, its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for $T2$ in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 ($T1$), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing $T2$ and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as $T1$, Crk, and $T2$, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A $T1$ ($T2$) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Crystal structure of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor bound to the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. The crystal structure of the human $T1$ inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ($T2$) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. p27Kip1 binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

Th1/Th2 type cytokines in hepatitis B patients treated with interferon-alpha. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the expression of Th1/Th2 type cytokines and the effect of interferon-alpha therapy. METHODS: Th1/Th2 type cytokines were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: Levels of IFN-gamma in the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultures from the patients with hepatitis B were slightly lower than those of controls (P = 0.07). However, the levels of IL-4 were higher than those of controls (P = 0.01). Cytokines measurements during IFN-alpha treatment showed a trend to decreasing levels of IL-4 at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Levels of $T1$ were slightly increased following $T2$ treatment (P = 0.09). In patients with a complete response to IFN-alpha, the levels of IFN-gamma were higher at 24 weeks following IFN-alpha treatment than that of pre-treatment (P = 0.04), and the levels of IL-4 decreased markedly at 12 and 24 weeks (P = 0.02, 0.03, respectively). mRNA expression positively correlated with the level of Th1/Th2 type cytokines in the supernatant. CONCLUSION: The expression of Th2 type cytokines is predominant in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Interferon-alpha therapy can modulate the balance of Th1/Th2 type cytokines, and this is related to its clinical effect. Levels of Th1/Th2 type cytokines could be a predictor of clinical response during Interferon-alpha treatment.

We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell $T1$ complexes $T2$, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the $T1$ receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the $T2$, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

A comparative study of E-cadherin and stromelysin-3 expression in de novo and ex adenoma carcinoma of the colorectum. An apparent exception to the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma carcinogenetic pathway is the so-called "de novo" carcinoma which has no evidence of adenoma in its vicinity. Despite the fact that they are often quite small, these lesions appear to be more aggressive (i.e., greater likelihood of lymph-node metastases) than carcinomas that clearly arise from surrounding adenomas exadenoma carcinoma. The purpose of the present comparative immunohistochemical study was to compare rates of cell adhesion molecule (E-cadherin) and protease [stromelysin-3 ($T1$$T2$) and protease [stromelysin-3 (ST-3)] expression in groups of de novo (n=64) and ex adenoma (n=42) lesions in order to see whether their more aggressive behavior is associated with decreased cell adhesion and increased protease expression. The rates of extensive ST-3 expression and decreased E-cadherin expression were significantly higher in the de novo group (P=0.014 and 0.005, respectively). Histopathologically, the de novo group also had a significantly higher percentage of cases with an infiltrative invasion pattern. These differences highlight the more aggressive phenotype of the de novo colorectal carcinoma and fit with their greater invasive potential.

Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described $T1$ species which either lack or contain $T2$ (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that $T1$ is a critical target for $T2$-activated transcription.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with $T1$$T2$ associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Specific activation of cdc25 tyrosine phosphatases by B-type cyclins: evidence for multiple roles of mitotic cyclins. Two previously unidentified human cdc25 genes have been isolated, cdc25A and cdc25B. Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast. Microinjection of anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. cdc25A and cdc25B display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either cyclin B1 or B2 but not A or D1. Association between cdc25A and cyclin B1/cdc2 was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the $T1$ protein kinase, but also activate the $T2$ tyrosine phosphatase, of which cdc2 is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with $T1$$T2$ is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, $T1$ (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind $T2$. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. $T1$ mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor ($T2$)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and $T1$ interact with $T2$ in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of $T1$ indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and $T2$. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that p300 and CBP might be involved in YY1-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between YY1 and p300, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of $T1$$T2$ and p300, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of CREB-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of CTF-1-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between YY1 and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress Sp1- and CREB-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a $T1$$T2$, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The $T1$-$T2$-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90).

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein ($T1$)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell $T2$ complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate $T1$$T2$ knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the $T1$$T2$ resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Biological data and clinical symptoms as predictors of astrogliosis and neurodegeneration in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) and light subunit neurofilament protein (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Correlations between GFAp and $T1$$T2$ and NFL in CSF as markers for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration, and clinical and biological data were investigated. Abnormal levels of GFAp and NFL were significantly associated with increasing CSF cell number and protein concentration, and with the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirate. A significant association was found between abnormal NFL and presence of trypanosomes in CSF, abnormal limb movements, difficulties in gait and coordination, and low Karnofsky index. By multivariate analysis, it was shown that increasing CSF cell number, increasing CSF protein concentration, and the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in the lymph node aspirate were the best predictors for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration among the variables tested. These results demonstrate the importance of CSF cell count and protein determination in assessment of the severity of central nervous system involvement and reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis to assess the stage of the disease. The clinical symptoms studied were less useful in predicting astrogliosis or neurodegeneration.

Crystal structure of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor bound to the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. The crystal structure of the human p27Kip1 kinase inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-$T1$$T2$ inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. p27Kip1 binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-$T1$ and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/$T2$ cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in $T1$$T2$ site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Human gastrinoma cells express calcium-sensing receptor. The intravenous calcium injection test has been reported to be useful for the diagnosis of gastrinoma. However, the mechanism underlying calcium-evoked gastrin release is not fully understood. We investigated the mechanism of calcium-stimulated gastrin release from gastrinoma cells in vitro with a particular focus on the $T1$$T2$ release from gastrinoma cells in vitro with a particular focus on the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR). Human gastrinoma cells were taken from mechanically minced gastrinoma tissues obtained at surgery. In the perifusion system, high [Ca2+]o induced gastrin release from gastrinoma cells. As [Ca2+]o increased, [Ca2+]i rapidly increased, as monitored by fluorometry. The response was not inhibited by nifedipine, a blocker of the voltage-dependent calcium channel. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent Southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of the CaR gene in human gastrinoma tissues. Moreover, the expression of CaR in gastrinoma tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated that CaR was expressed in human gastrinoma cells and could be involved in the mechanism of calcium-evoked gastrin release.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and $T1$$T2$, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), $T1$, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip ($T2$). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Interaction with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by serum response factor. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that $T1$ binds the $T2$ subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with $T1$$T2$, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for $T1$ and 205,000 and 244,000 for $T2$, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain $T1$ (hTFIID alpha and $T2$ respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, $T1$, to $T2$. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to HSP27 and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four $T1$-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and $T2$), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or $T1$$T2$ mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 ($T1$) that activates human $T2$. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral IL-6-gp130 binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Th1/Th2 type cytokines in hepatitis B patients treated with interferon-alpha. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the expression of Th1/Th2 type cytokines and the effect of interferon-alpha therapy. METHODS: Th1/Th2 type cytokines were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: Levels of IFN-gamma in the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultures from the patients with hepatitis B were slightly lower than those of controls (P = 0.07). However, the levels of IL-4 were higher than those of controls (P = 0.01). Cytokines measurements during IFN-alpha treatment showed a trend to decreasing levels of IL-4 at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Levels of IFN-gamma were slightly increased following IFN-alpha treatment (P = 0.09). In patients with a complete response to $T1$, the levels of $T2$ were higher at 24 weeks following IFN-alpha treatment than that of pre-treatment (P = 0.04), and the levels of IL-4 decreased markedly at 12 and 24 weeks (P = 0.02, 0.03, respectively). mRNA expression positively correlated with the level of Th1/Th2 type cytokines in the supernatant. CONCLUSION: The expression of Th2 type cytokines is predominant in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Interferon-alpha therapy can modulate the balance of Th1/Th2 type cytokines, and this is related to its clinical effect. Levels of Th1/Th2 type cytokines could be a predictor of clinical response during Interferon-alpha treatment.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since $T1$-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and $T2$ from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. $T1$ activity and the regulatory $T2$ subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Crystal structure of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor bound to the $T1$-$T2$ complex. The crystal structure of the human p27Kip1 kinase inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. p27Kip1 binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

Human gastrinoma cells express calcium-sensing receptor. The intravenous calcium injection test has been reported to be useful for the diagnosis of gastrinoma. However, the mechanism underlying calcium-evoked gastrin release is not fully understood. We investigated the mechanism of calcium-stimulated gastrin release from gastrinoma cells in vitro with a particular focus on the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR). Human gastrinoma cells were taken from mechanically minced gastrinoma tissues obtained at surgery. In the perifusion system, high [Ca2+]o induced gastrin release from gastrinoma cells. As [Ca2+]o increased, [Ca2+]i rapidly increased, as monitored by fluorometry. The response was not inhibited by nifedipine, a blocker of the voltage-dependent calcium channel. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent Southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of the CaR gene in human gastrinoma tissues. Moreover, the expression of CaR in gastrinoma tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated that CaR was expressed in human gastrinoma cells and could be involved in the mechanism of calcium-evoked $T1$$T2$ was expressed in human gastrinoma cells and could be involved in the mechanism of calcium-evoked gastrin release.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell $T1$ complexes hTAFII28, $T2$ and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This $T1$-$T2$ interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120).

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the $T1$-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on $T2$, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the $T1$ cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind $T2$. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that p300 and CBP might be involved in YY1-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between YY1 and p300, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of $T1$$T2$, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of CREB-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of CTF-1-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between YY1 and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress Sp1- and CREB-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

Interaction with $T1$ subunit of TFIIF is required for transcriptional activation by $T2$. A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size ($T1$$T2$--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in $T1$$T2$, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a $T1$$T2$, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of $T1$ or $T2$ binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for $T1$ can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing $T2$ and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, $T1$$T2$ and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether $T1$, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with $T2$ following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that $T1$ and CBP might be involved in $T2$-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between YY1 and p300, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of CREB-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of CTF-1-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between YY1 and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress Sp1- and CREB-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for $T1$ and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three $T2$ molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli.

These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, K5, and $T1$$T2$, K5, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

The retinoblastoma protein binds to RIZ, a zinc-finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus E1A protein. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins, we have searched cDNA libraries for Rb-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein RIZ from rat and human cells. RIZ is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc-finger motifs. It contains an Rb-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of E1A. A domain is conserved between $T1$ and the $T2$/Blimp-1 differentiation factor. Other motifs of RIZ include putative GTPase and SH3 (src homology domain 3) domains. RIZ is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues. It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While the function of RIZ is not yet clear, its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for RIZ in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. $T1$ is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)$T2$. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or $T1$ in vivo, and the specificity of $T2$ or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that $T1$ interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with $T2$. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, $T1$ may serve as a link between Syk and $T2$, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

The $T1$ glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and $T2$. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four $T1$-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins $T2$ and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for $T1$ can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and $T2$ (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned $T1$ cDNA and $T2$ cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Human $T1$, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the $T2$ gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-$T1$ and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for $T2$ and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of $T1$ bound to the extracellular domain of $T2$ (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Biological data and clinical symptoms as predictors of astrogliosis and neurodegeneration in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) and light subunit neurofilament protein (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Correlations between GFAp and NFL in CSF as markers for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration, and clinical and biological data were investigated. Abnormal levels of $T1$ and $T2$ were significantly associated with increasing CSF cell number and protein concentration, and with the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirate. A significant association was found between abnormal NFL and presence of trypanosomes in CSF, abnormal limb movements, difficulties in gait and coordination, and low Karnofsky index. By multivariate analysis, it was shown that increasing CSF cell number, increasing CSF protein concentration, and the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in the lymph node aspirate were the best predictors for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration among the variables tested. These results demonstrate the importance of CSF cell count and protein determination in assessment of the severity of central nervous system involvement and reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis to assess the stage of the disease. The clinical symptoms studied were less useful in predicting astrogliosis or neurodegeneration.

Human gastrinoma cells express calcium-sensing receptor. The intravenous calcium injection test has been reported to be useful for the diagnosis of gastrinoma. However, the mechanism underlying calcium-evoked gastrin release is not fully understood. We investigated the mechanism of calcium-stimulated gastrin release from gastrinoma cells in vitro with a particular focus on the calcium-sensing receptor ($T1$$T2$ release from gastrinoma cells in vitro with a particular focus on the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR). Human gastrinoma cells were taken from mechanically minced gastrinoma tissues obtained at surgery. In the perifusion system, high [Ca2+]o induced gastrin release from gastrinoma cells. As [Ca2+]o increased, [Ca2+]i rapidly increased, as monitored by fluorometry. The response was not inhibited by nifedipine, a blocker of the voltage-dependent calcium channel. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent Southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of the CaR gene in human gastrinoma tissues. Moreover, the expression of CaR in gastrinoma tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated that CaR was expressed in human gastrinoma cells and could be involved in the mechanism of calcium-evoked gastrin release.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the $T1$ and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and $T2$, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-$T1$ and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many $T2$ interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, $T1$ (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and $T2$. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind $T1$ with high affinity but do not bind $T2$. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a $T1$$T2$/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro.

Biological data and clinical symptoms as predictors of astrogliosis and neurodegeneration in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Concentrations of $T1$ (GFAp) and $T2$ (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Correlations between GFAp and NFL in CSF as markers for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration, and clinical and biological data were investigated. Abnormal levels of GFAp and NFL were significantly associated with increasing CSF cell number and protein concentration, and with the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirate. A significant association was found between abnormal NFL and presence of trypanosomes in CSF, abnormal limb movements, difficulties in gait and coordination, and low Karnofsky index. By multivariate analysis, it was shown that increasing CSF cell number, increasing CSF protein concentration, and the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in the lymph node aspirate were the best predictors for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration among the variables tested. These results demonstrate the importance of CSF cell count and protein determination in assessment of the severity of central nervous system involvement and reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis to assess the stage of the disease. The clinical symptoms studied were less useful in predicting astrogliosis or neurodegeneration.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 ($T1$ alpha and $T2$ respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa $T1$ (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing $T2$. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that $T1$ and $T2$ form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early $T1$ complexes containing hsp70 and $T2$ (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either $T1$ or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the $T2$ subunit.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/$T1$ ($T2$) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A $T1$ model based on $T2$ indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the $T1$-calnexin and the $T2$-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on $T1$$T2$ binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the $T1$ receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein ($T2$) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since $T1$ and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that $T2$ is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both $T1$ and calreticulin interact with $T2$ in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/$T1$ (Flk-1) and $T2$. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase ($T1$) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn ($T2$) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa $T1$ ($T2$) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

A comparative study of E-cadherin and stromelysin-3 expression in de novo and ex adenoma carcinoma of the colorectum. An apparent exception to the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma carcinogenetic pathway is the so-called "de novo" carcinoma which has no evidence of adenoma in its vicinity. Despite the fact that they are often quite small, these lesions appear to be more aggressive (i.e., greater likelihood of lymph-node metastases) than carcinomas that clearly arise from surrounding adenomas exadenoma carcinoma. The purpose of the present comparative immunohistochemical study was to compare rates of cell adhesion molecule (E-cadherin) and protease [$T1$ ($T2$)] expression in groups of de novo (n=64) and ex adenoma (n=42) lesions in order to see whether their more aggressive behavior is associated with decreased cell adhesion and increased protease expression. The rates of extensive ST-3 expression and decreased E-cadherin expression were significantly higher in the de novo group (P=0.014 and 0.005, respectively). Histopathologically, the de novo group also had a significantly higher percentage of cases with an infiltrative invasion pattern. These differences highlight the more aggressive phenotype of the de novo colorectal carcinoma and fit with their greater invasive potential.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and $T1$ with $T2$. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or $T1$ to $T2$ is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described $T1$ species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)$T2$. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of $T1$$T2$ and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Th1/Th2 type cytokines in hepatitis B patients treated with interferon-alpha. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the expression of Th1/Th2 type cytokines and the effect of interferon-alpha therapy. METHODS: Th1/Th2 type cytokines were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: Levels of IFN-gamma in the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultures from the patients with hepatitis B were slightly lower than those of controls (P = 0.07). However, the levels of IL-4 were higher than those of controls (P = 0.01). Cytokines measurements during IFN-alpha treatment showed a trend to decreasing levels of IL-4 at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Levels of IFN-gamma were slightly increased following IFN-alpha treatment (P = 0.09). In patients with a complete response to $T1$, the levels of IFN-gamma were higher at 24 weeks following $T2$ treatment than that of pre-treatment (P = 0.04), and the levels of IL-4 decreased markedly at 12 and 24 weeks (P = 0.02, 0.03, respectively). mRNA expression positively correlated with the level of Th1/Th2 type cytokines in the supernatant. CONCLUSION: The expression of Th2 type cytokines is predominant in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Interferon-alpha therapy can modulate the balance of Th1/Th2 type cytokines, and this is related to its clinical effect. Levels of Th1/Th2 type cytokines could be a predictor of clinical response during Interferon-alpha treatment.

This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins.

Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin.

Identification of an 11-kDa FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain within the 289-kDa FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein and characterization of a critical serine residue. Complexed with its intracellular receptor, FKBP12, the natural product rapamycin inhibits G1 progression of the cell cycle in a variety of mammalian cell lines and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae. Previously, a mammalian protein that directly associates with FKBP12-rapamycin has been identified and its encoding gene has been cloned from both human (designated FRAP) [Brown, E.J., Albers, M.W., Shin, T.B., Ichikawa, K., Keith, C.T., Lane, W.S. & Schreiber, S.L. (1994) Nature (London) 369, 756-758] and rat (designated RAFT) [Sabatini, D.M., Erdjument-Bromage, H., Lui, M., Tempst, P. & Snyder, S.H. (1994) Cell 78, 35-43]. The full-length FRAP is a 289-kDa protein containing a putative phosphatidylinositol kinase domain. Using an in vitro transcription/translation assay method coupled with proteolysis studies, we have identified an 11-kDa $T1$-rapamycin-binding domain within $T2$. This minimal binding domain lies N-terminal to the kinase domain and spans residues 2025-2114. In addition, we have carried out mutagenesis studies to investigate the role of Ser2035, a potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C within this domain. We now show that the FRAP Ser2035-->Ala mutant displays similar binding affinity when compared with the wild-type protein, whereas all other mutations at this site, including mimics of phosphoserine, abolish binding, presumably due to either unfavorable steric interactions or induced conformational changes.

The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins $T1$$T2$, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. $T1$ also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with $T2$ and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding $T1$/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with $T2$ binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. $T1$ showed genetic interactions with the $T2$ gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes ($T1$$T2$ complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, $T1$ may serve as a link between $T2$ and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein $T1$ also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and $T2$ has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Potential cellular signatures of viral infections in human hematopoietic cells. Expression profiling of cellular genes was performed using a 10,000 cDNA human gene array in order to identify expression changes following chronic infection of human hematopoietic cells with Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Virus (KSHV) also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and Human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). We performed cell-free in vitro infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells using semi-purified HHV8 and a mature IL-2 dependent T cell line, KIT 225, using highly concentrated viral stocks prepared from an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-1. Thirty days post infection, mRNA was isolated from infected cultures and uninfected controls and submitted for microarray analysis. More than 400 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following HHV8 infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells. Of these 400, interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), cyclin B2, TBP-associated factor, eukaryotic elongation factor and $T1$$T2$ (IRF4), cyclin B2, TBP-associated factor, eukaryotic elongation factor and pim 2 were up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. In contrast, less than 100 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following chronic infection of a mature T cell line with HTLV-1. Of these, only cdc7 was up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. These data may provide insight into cellular signatures of infection useful for diagnosis of infection as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, $T1$$T2$, K2, K5, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

Th1/Th2 type cytokines in hepatitis B patients treated with interferon-alpha. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the expression of Th1/Th2 type cytokines and the effect of interferon-alpha therapy. METHODS: Th1/Th2 type cytokines were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: Levels of IFN-gamma in the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultures from the patients with hepatitis B were slightly lower than those of controls (P = 0.07). However, the levels of IL-4 were higher than those of controls (P = 0.01). Cytokines measurements during IFN-alpha treatment showed a trend to decreasing levels of IL-4 at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Levels of IFN-gamma were slightly increased following IFN-alpha treatment (P = 0.09). In patients with a complete response to $T1$, the levels of IFN-gamma were higher at 24 weeks following IFN-alpha treatment than that of pre-treatment (P = 0.04), and the levels of $T2$ decreased markedly at 12 and 24 weeks (P = 0.02, 0.03, respectively). mRNA expression positively correlated with the level of Th1/Th2 type cytokines in the supernatant. CONCLUSION: The expression of Th2 type cytokines is predominant in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Interferon-alpha therapy can modulate the balance of Th1/Th2 type cytokines, and this is related to its clinical effect. Levels of Th1/Th2 type cytokines could be a predictor of clinical response during Interferon-alpha treatment.

Specific binding of the transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII, to HSP27. HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet $T1$ to $T2$ and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), $T1$, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and $T2$ (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Identification of an 11-kDa FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain within the 289-kDa FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein and characterization of a critical serine residue. Complexed with its intracellular receptor, FKBP12, the natural product rapamycin inhibits G1 progression of the cell cycle in a variety of mammalian cell lines and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae. Previously, a mammalian protein that directly associates with $T1$-rapamycin has been identified and its encoding gene has been cloned from both human (designated $T2$) [Brown, E.J., Albers, M.W., Shin, T.B., Ichikawa, K., Keith, C.T., Lane, W.S. & Schreiber, S.L. (1994) Nature (London) 369, 756-758] and rat (designated RAFT) [Sabatini, D.M., Erdjument-Bromage, H., Lui, M., Tempst, P. & Snyder, S.H. (1994) Cell 78, 35-43]. The full-length FRAP is a 289-kDa protein containing a putative phosphatidylinositol kinase domain. Using an in vitro transcription/translation assay method coupled with proteolysis studies, we have identified an 11-kDa FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain within FRAP. This minimal binding domain lies N-terminal to the kinase domain and spans residues 2025-2114. In addition, we have carried out mutagenesis studies to investigate the role of Ser2035, a potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C within this domain. We now show that the FRAP Ser2035-->Ala mutant displays similar binding affinity when compared with the wild-type protein, whereas all other mutations at this site, including mimics of phosphoserine, abolish binding, presumably due to either unfavorable steric interactions or induced conformational changes.

Levels of Th1/Th2 type cytokines could be a predictor of clinical response during Interferon-alpha treatment.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing $T1$ and $T2$ (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Potential cellular signatures of viral infections in human hematopoietic cells. Expression profiling of cellular genes was performed using a 10,000 cDNA human gene array in order to identify expression changes following chronic infection of human hematopoietic cells with Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Virus (KSHV) also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and Human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). We performed cell-free in vitro infection of primary bone marrow derived $T1$+ cells using semi-purified HHV8 and a mature $T2$ dependent T cell line, KIT 225, using highly concentrated viral stocks prepared from an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-1. Thirty days post infection, mRNA was isolated from infected cultures and uninfected controls and submitted for microarray analysis. More than 400 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following HHV8 infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells. Of these 400, interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), cyclin B2, TBP-associated factor, eukaryotic elongation factor and pim 2 were up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. In contrast, less than 100 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following chronic infection of a mature T cell line with HTLV-1. Of these, only cdc7 was up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. These data may provide insight into cellular signatures of infection useful for diagnosis of infection as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the $T1$-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many $T2$ interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, $T1$ and $T2$. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the $T1$$T2$ is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by $T1$ or $T2$.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with $T1$ as $T2$. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an $T1$ binding protein ($T2$) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, $T1$ ($T2$)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for $T1$$T2$ and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking $T1$$T2$ functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

The retinoblastoma protein binds to RIZ, a zinc-finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus E1A protein. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins, we have searched cDNA libraries for Rb-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein RIZ from rat and human cells. RIZ is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc-finger motifs. It contains an Rb-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of $T1$$T2$-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of E1A. A domain is conserved between RIZ and the PRDI-BF1/Blimp-1 differentiation factor. Other motifs of RIZ include putative GTPase and SH3 (src homology domain 3) domains. RIZ is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues. It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While the function of RIZ is not yet clear, its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for RIZ in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not $T1$$T2$, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that $T1$ interacts with $T2$ both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or $T1$ in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or $T2$ binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that $T1$ and $T2$ from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to $T1$$T2$) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, K5, and $T1$$T2$, K2, K5, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding $T1$/$T2$, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the $T1$$T2$ receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and $T1$ has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the $T2$. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that p300 and $T1$ might be involved in $T2$-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between YY1 and p300, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of CREB-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of CTF-1-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between YY1 and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress Sp1- and CREB-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

Th1/Th2 type cytokines in hepatitis B patients treated with interferon-alpha. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the expression of Th1/Th2 type cytokines and the effect of interferon-alpha therapy. METHODS: Th1/Th2 type cytokines were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: Levels of IFN-gamma in the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultures from the patients with hepatitis B were slightly lower than those of controls (P = 0.07). However, the levels of IL-4 were higher than those of controls (P = 0.01). Cytokines measurements during IFN-alpha treatment showed a trend to decreasing levels of IL-4 at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Levels of IFN-gamma were slightly increased following IFN-alpha treatment (P = 0.09). In patients with a complete response to IFN-alpha, the levels of $T1$ were higher at 24 weeks following IFN-alpha treatment than that of pre-treatment (P = 0.04), and the levels of $T2$ decreased markedly at 12 and 24 weeks (P = 0.02, 0.03, respectively). mRNA expression positively correlated with the level of Th1/Th2 type cytokines in the supernatant. CONCLUSION: The expression of Th2 type cytokines is predominant in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Interferon-alpha therapy can modulate the balance of Th1/Th2 type cytokines, and this is related to its clinical effect. Levels of Th1/Th2 type cytokines could be a predictor of clinical response during Interferon-alpha treatment.

We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, $T1$ also interacts directly with $T2$. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit ($T1$) of $T2$ with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. $T1$ and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and $T2$ reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter $T1$ is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and $T2$, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since $T1$ and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-$T2$-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that p300 and CBP might be involved in YY1-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between YY1 and p300, a coactivator for $T1$, is not sufficient for repression of $T2$-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of CTF-1-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between YY1 and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress Sp1- and CREB-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the $T1$ and associates with $T2$ homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the $T1$, but neither of these proteins binds $T2$. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor ($T1$)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and $T2$. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.

Crystal structure of the $T1$ cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor bound to the cyclin A-$T2$ complex. The crystal structure of the human p27Kip1 kinase inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. p27Kip1 binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or $T1$ in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the $T2$ subunit.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. $T1$ activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with $T2$ in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/$T1$) overexpressing $T2$. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early $T1$$T2$ complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either $T1$ or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or $T2$ binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with RII-anchoring proteins occurs through an amphipathic helix binding motif. The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 (Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, $T1$ (418-736), containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind $T2$ alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.

Proto-oncoprotein $T1$ interacts with $T2$ in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as Grb2, Crk, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of $T1$ or IL-1beta to $T2$ is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Cloning and characterization of $T1$, hTAFII20 and $T2$: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Human spleen tyrosine kinase p72Syk associates with the Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein. The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This $T1$-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since $T2$-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with $T1$$T2$ (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex. The activation of gp130, a shared signal-transducing receptor for a family of cytokines, is initiated by recognition of ligand followed by oligomerization into a higher order signaling complex. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activates human gp130. In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral IL-6 and human gp130, two complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of gp130 and site III of viral IL-6, which is necessary for receptor activation. Unlike human IL-6 (which uses many hydrophilic residues), the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact gp130, which enhances the complementarity of the viral $T1$-$T2$ binding interfaces. The cross-reactivity of gp130 is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic gp130 cytokine-binding sites.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three $T1$$T2$ cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules.

The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Biological data and clinical symptoms as predictors of astrogliosis and neurodegeneration in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) and light subunit neurofilament protein ($T1$$T2$ (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Correlations between GFAp and NFL in CSF as markers for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration, and clinical and biological data were investigated. Abnormal levels of GFAp and NFL were significantly associated with increasing CSF cell number and protein concentration, and with the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirate. A significant association was found between abnormal NFL and presence of trypanosomes in CSF, abnormal limb movements, difficulties in gait and coordination, and low Karnofsky index. By multivariate analysis, it was shown that increasing CSF cell number, increasing CSF protein concentration, and the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in the lymph node aspirate were the best predictors for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration among the variables tested. These results demonstrate the importance of CSF cell count and protein determination in assessment of the severity of central nervous system involvement and reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis to assess the stage of the disease. The clinical symptoms studied were less useful in predicting astrogliosis or neurodegeneration.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and $T1$$T2$, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

The $T1$ protein binds to RIZ, a zinc-finger protein that shares an epitope with the adenovirus $T2$ protein. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins, we have searched cDNA libraries for Rb-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein RIZ from rat and human cells. RIZ is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc-finger motifs. It contains an Rb-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of E1A. A domain is conserved between RIZ and the PRDI-BF1/Blimp-1 differentiation factor. Other motifs of RIZ include putative GTPase and SH3 (src homology domain 3) domains. RIZ is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues. It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While the function of RIZ is not yet clear, its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for RIZ in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or $T1$ binding is mediated by the $T2$ subunit.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of $T1$$T2$ functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Biological data and clinical symptoms as predictors of astrogliosis and neurodegeneration in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) and light subunit neurofilament protein ($T1$$T2$ (GFAp) and light subunit neurofilament protein (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness. Correlations between GFAp and NFL in CSF as markers for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration, and clinical and biological data were investigated. Abnormal levels of GFAp and NFL were significantly associated with increasing CSF cell number and protein concentration, and with the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirate. A significant association was found between abnormal NFL and presence of trypanosomes in CSF, abnormal limb movements, difficulties in gait and coordination, and low Karnofsky index. By multivariate analysis, it was shown that increasing CSF cell number, increasing CSF protein concentration, and the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in the lymph node aspirate were the best predictors for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration among the variables tested. These results demonstrate the importance of CSF cell count and protein determination in assessment of the severity of central nervous system involvement and reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis to assess the stage of the disease. The clinical symptoms studied were less useful in predicting astrogliosis or neurodegeneration.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that p300 and CBP might be involved in YY1-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between YY1 and p300, a coactivator for $T1$$T2$ and p300, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of CREB-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of CTF-1-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between YY1 and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress Sp1- and CREB-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of GT155 and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated CAP-60 (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with $T1$$T2$ mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

Potential cellular signatures of viral infections in human hematopoietic cells. Expression profiling of cellular genes was performed using a 10,000 cDNA human gene array in order to identify expression changes following chronic infection of human hematopoietic cells with Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Virus (KSHV) also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and Human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). We performed cell-free in vitro infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells using semi-purified HHV8 and a mature IL-2 dependent T cell line, KIT 225, using highly concentrated viral stocks prepared from an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-1. Thirty days post infection, mRNA was isolated from infected cultures and uninfected controls and submitted for microarray analysis. More than 400 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following HHV8 infection of primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells. Of these 400, $T1$ ($T2$), cyclin B2, TBP-associated factor, eukaryotic elongation factor and pim 2 were up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. In contrast, less than 100 genes were differentially expressed more than two-fold following chronic infection of a mature T cell line with HTLV-1. Of these, only cdc7 was up-regulated more than 3.5 fold. These data may provide insight into cellular signatures of infection useful for diagnosis of infection as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Specific activation of cdc25 tyrosine phosphatases by B-type cyclins: evidence for multiple roles of mitotic cyclins. Two previously unidentified human cdc25 genes have been isolated, cdc25A and cdc25B. Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast. Microinjection of anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. $T1$ and $T2$ display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either cyclin B1 or B2 but not A or D1. Association between cdc25A and cyclin B1/cdc2 was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the cdc2 protein kinase, but also activate the cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase, of which cdc2 is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.

Biochemical properties of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. Characterization of ligand binding, internalization, and receptor phosphorylation. An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of $T1$ from 32P-labeled 293/$T2$ cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.

Human cyclin E, a new cyclin that interacts with two members of the CDC2 gene family. A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the $T1$$T2$ gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 ($T1$ and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)$T2$. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32).

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of $T1$ or p107 binding is mediated by the $T2$ subunit.

Thymocyte activation induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and pp120 with CD5. CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, T cells, and a subset of B cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking studies or studies on CD5 knockout mice implicate CD5 as a co-stimulatory or negative regulatory molecule. CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) residues following Tcell activation. Y429 and Y441 occur in an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence. We investigated whether phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM, interacts with CD5 following T cell activation. $T1$ activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of $T2$ associated with CD5 in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes. Cellular p85 as well as the recombinant Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of p85 bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide encompassing Y463 with approximately threefold greater affinity than a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated Y429-Y441 peptide. Binding of the C-SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide, together with preferential binding of the N-SH2 domain to the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide, suggests a bivalent interaction. A 120-kDa phosphoprotein (pp120) associated with CD5 and specifically with the Y429-Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes. We conclude that stimulation of thymocytes with pervanadate induces the recruitment of PI 3-kinase and pp120 to CD5.

Cloning and characterization of a specific interleukin (IL)-13 binding protein structurally related to the IL-5 receptor alpha chain. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with $T1$$T2$) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many, but not all, biological activities with IL-4. These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail. The IL-13R shows homology with the IL-5 receptor, and to a lesser extent, with the prolactin receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13R cDNA bind IL-13 with high affinity but do not bind IL-4. COS-7 cells co-transfected with the cloned IL-13R cDNA and IL-4R cDNA resulted in the reconstitution of a small number of receptors that recognized both IL-4 and IL-13. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected the receptor transcript only in cell lines known to bind IL-13.

The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Interactions of p60, a mediator of progesterone receptor assembly, with heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp70. Previous studies on the assembly of progesterone receptor (PR) complexes in vitro have suggested that PR assembly is a dynamic, ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins. One of these proteins, p60, appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature PR complexes. In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48). This observation supports a model in which p60 functions at an intermediate stage of PR assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent PR complexes lacking p60. Since p60 is typically found in a complex with hsp90 and hsp70, we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins. P60 can bind either hsp70 or hsp90 independently and in an ATP-independent manner. Since hsp90 and hsp70 do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex. Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for hsp70 binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding hsp90 and hsp70. The hsp90-p60-hsp70 multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the hsp90-binding drug geldanamycin. The interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 in intermediate PR complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early PR complexes (hsp70) or in mature $T1$$T2$ complexes (hsp70) or in mature PR complexes (hsp90). From these results, it appears that p60 is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of PR complexes.

Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of $T1$ bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R ($T2$) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.

Proto-oncoprotein Vav interacts with c-Cbl in activated thymocytes and peripheral T cells. The molecular adapter c-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the TCR and associates with Src homology domain-2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing adapters such as $T1$, $T2$, and Crk-L, which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family. This suggests that c-Cbl may link TCR activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins. The SH2/SH3-containing protein Vav also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the TCR. Here we show that Vav and c-Cbl form inducible molecular complexes in TCR-activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate-treated T cells. Vav/c-Cbl interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene-targeted mice that lack the T cell-specific inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, in which c-Cbl is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The interaction between Vav and c-Cbl is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of Vav and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. In addition, we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in c-Cbl is the binding site for the Vav SH2 domain in vitro. These data imply that c-Cbl is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of Vav in thymocytes and peripheral T cells.

The glut 1 glucose transporter interacts with calnexin and calreticulin. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of calnexin with glycoproteins in vitro. A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein Glut 1 (GT155) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum, a cross-linker-independent association was observed between GT155 and calnexin. In addition, the anti-calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV-dependent cross-linking product consisting of $T1$ and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated $T2$ (calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa). Both the GT155-calnexin and the GT155-CAP-60 interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on GT155, a characteristic of many calnexin interactions. A GT155 mutant that was not glycosylated (AGGT155) did not associate with calnexin or CAP-60. Calreticulin, the soluble homologue of calnexin, was also shown to interact with GT155 only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group. Thus, our data show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.

A comparative study of $T1$ and $T2$ expression in de novo and ex adenoma carcinoma of the colorectum. An apparent exception to the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma carcinogenetic pathway is the so-called "de novo" carcinoma which has no evidence of adenoma in its vicinity. Despite the fact that they are often quite small, these lesions appear to be more aggressive (i.e., greater likelihood of lymph-node metastases) than carcinomas that clearly arise from surrounding adenomas exadenoma carcinoma. The purpose of the present comparative immunohistochemical study was to compare rates of cell adhesion molecule (E-cadherin) and protease [stromelysin-3 (ST-3)] expression in groups of de novo (n=64) and ex adenoma (n=42) lesions in order to see whether their more aggressive behavior is associated with decreased cell adhesion and increased protease expression. The rates of extensive ST-3 expression and decreased E-cadherin expression were significantly higher in the de novo group (P=0.014 and 0.005, respectively). Histopathologically, the de novo group also had a significantly higher percentage of cases with an infiltrative invasion pattern. These differences highlight the more aggressive phenotype of the de novo colorectal carcinoma and fit with their greater invasive potential.

Th1/Th2 type cytokines in hepatitis B patients treated with interferon-alpha. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the expression of Th1/Th2 type cytokines and the effect of interferon-alpha therapy. METHODS: Th1/Th2 type cytokines were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: Levels of IFN-gamma in the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultures from the patients with hepatitis B were slightly lower than those of controls (P = 0.07). However, the levels of IL-4 were higher than those of controls (P = 0.01). Cytokines measurements during $T1$ treatment showed a trend to decreasing levels of $T2$ at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Levels of IFN-gamma were slightly increased following IFN-alpha treatment (P = 0.09). In patients with a complete response to IFN-alpha, the levels of IFN-gamma were higher at 24 weeks following IFN-alpha treatment than that of pre-treatment (P = 0.04), and the levels of IL-4 decreased markedly at 12 and 24 weeks (P = 0.02, 0.03, respectively). mRNA expression positively correlated with the level of Th1/Th2 type cytokines in the supernatant. CONCLUSION: The expression of Th2 type cytokines is predominant in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Interferon-alpha therapy can modulate the balance of Th1/Th2 type cytokines, and this is related to its clinical effect. Levels of Th1/Th2 type cytokines could be a predictor of clinical response during Interferon-alpha treatment.
