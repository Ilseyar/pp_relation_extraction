Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger $T1$$T2$ binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the $T1$ cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of $T2$ amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The $T1$ and $T2$ receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the $T1$ complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/$T2$ ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator ($T1$$T2$) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 ($T1$$T2$, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA $T1$$T2$ NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Evidence for physical interaction between the zinc-finger transcription factors YY1 and Sp1. Two promoter elements are important for basal-level transcription, the TATA motif typically located 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and the initiator (Inr) element encompassing the start site. The mechanism of how Inr elements work is poorly understood, partly because very few proteins that bind to Inr elements have been identified and isolated. The recently cloned YY1 is such an Inr-binding protein. YY1 is able to direct transcription upon binding to its recognition sequence in vitro. The ability of YY1 to initiate transcription is augmented by the presence of a TATA motif or binding sites for transcription factor Sp1. To study the mechanism underlying the apparent functional cooperation between YY1 and Sp1, we explored the possibility of protein-protein interactions between these two transcription factors. We found that $T1$ and $T2$ can form a physical complex. In addition, we identified domains within YY1 and Sp1 that mediate their interactions with each other. The physical interaction between YY1 and Sp1 may thus form the basis for the functional interplay observed previously.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/$T1$ (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed $T2$. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

Regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis by activin .The aim of this review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which activin A modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Activin A, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily, has various effects on diverse biological systems, including cell growth inhibition in many cell types. However, the mechanism(s) by which activin exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood. This review highlights activin's effects on activin receptors and signaling pathway, modulation of activin signaling, and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by activin. Based on the experiences of all the authors, we emphasized cell cycle inhibitors such as p16 and p21 and regulators of apoptosis such as $T1$$T2$ and p21 and regulators of apoptosis such as p53 and members of the bcl-2 family. Aside from activin's inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis, other newly developed methods for molecular studies of apoptosis by activin were briefly presented that support the role of activin as an inhibitor of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. These methods include subtractive hybridization based on covalent bonding, a simple and accurate means to determine molecular profile of as few as 20 cells based on an RNA-PCR approach, and a messenger RNA-antisense DNA interference phenomenon (D-RNAi), resulting in a long-term gene knockout effects.

Molecular determinants of the interaction between the C-terminal domain of Alzheimer's $T1$ and $T2$ alpha-helices. In a previous work, we predicted and demonstrated that the 29-42-residue fragment of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta peptide) has in vitro capacities close to those of the tilted fragment of viral fusion proteins. We further demonstrated that apolipoprotein E2 and E3 but not apolipoprotein E4 can decrease the fusogenic activity of Abeta(29-42) via a direct interaction. Therefore, we suggested that this fragment is implicated in the neurotoxicity of Abeta and in the protective effects of apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease. Because structurally related apolipoproteins do not interact with the Abeta C-terminal domain but inhibit viral fusion, we suggested that interactions existing between fusogenic peptides and apolipoproteins are selective and responsible for the inhibition of fusion. In this study, we simulated interactions of all amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins E and A-I with Abeta and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) fusogenic fragments by molecular modeling. We further calculated cross-interactions that do not inhibit fusion in vitro. The results suggest that interactions of hydrophobic residues are the major event to inhibit the fusogenic capacities of Abeta(29-42) and SIV peptides. Selectivity of those interactions is due to the steric complementarity between bulky hydrophobic residues in the fusogenic fragments and hydrophobic residues in the apolipoprotein C-terminal amphipathic helices.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with $T1$ on T cell lines lacking either ADA or $T2$ enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

The rates of commitment to renaturation of rhodanese and glutamine synthetase in the presence of the groE chaperonins. Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which rhodanese and glutamine synthetase (GS) are released from groEL in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, $T1$ undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does $T2$. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3.

Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena.

In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block $T1$$T2$ or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that $T1$ dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on $T2$. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand ($T1$/$T2$). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis by activin .The aim of this review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which activin A modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Activin A, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily, has various effects on diverse biological systems, including cell growth inhibition in many cell types. However, the mechanism(s) by which activin exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood. This review highlights activin's effects on activin receptors and signaling pathway, modulation of activin signaling, and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by activin. Based on the experiences of all the authors, we emphasized cell cycle inhibitors such as p16 and p21 and regulators of apoptosis such as p53 and members of the $T1$$T2$ and regulators of apoptosis such as p53 and members of the bcl-2 family. Aside from activin's inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis, other newly developed methods for molecular studies of apoptosis by activin were briefly presented that support the role of activin as an inhibitor of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. These methods include subtractive hybridization based on covalent bonding, a simple and accurate means to determine molecular profile of as few as 20 cells based on an RNA-PCR approach, and a messenger RNA-antisense DNA interference phenomenon (D-RNAi), resulting in a long-term gene knockout effects.

The POU domains of the $T1$ and $T2$ transcription factors mediate specific interaction with TBP. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked $T1$$T2$ complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like $T1$, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of $T2$, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease: review of population association studies. Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Accordingly, a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules tumour necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist ($T1$$T2$ and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1. Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting, the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the $T1$$T2$ stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that $T1$ but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated $T2$ by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the TRKB receptor. Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble TRKB by affinity separation and chemical cross-linking. The extracellular domain of the human neurotrophin $T1$ receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for brain-derived neurotrophic factor ($T2$). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103-181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342-394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248-398) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343-379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347, Asp354, and Tyr361 are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the TRKB receptor in binding BDNF.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 ($T1$) and $T2$ (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. $T1$, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase ($T2$) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the $T1$$T2$ complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to $T1$, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to $T2$, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity $T1$$T2$ receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. $T1$ also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine $T2$. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

The POU domains of the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors mediate specific interaction with TBP. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with $T1$, the TATA box binding protein component of the $T2$ factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or $T1$ enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and $T2$ did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with $T1$/TR2 and $T2$, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease: review of population association studies. Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Accordingly, a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules tumour necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist ($T1$), $T2$ (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1. Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting, the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single $T1$ molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with $T2$. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the $T1$/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by $T2$/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a $T1$ ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of $T2$. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor ($T1$) and those in $T2$ involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Evidence for physical interaction between the zinc-finger transcription factors $T1$ and $T2$. Two promoter elements are important for basal-level transcription, the TATA motif typically located 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and the initiator (Inr) element encompassing the start site. The mechanism of how Inr elements work is poorly understood, partly because very few proteins that bind to Inr elements have been identified and isolated. The recently cloned YY1 is such an Inr-binding protein. YY1 is able to direct transcription upon binding to its recognition sequence in vitro. The ability of YY1 to initiate transcription is augmented by the presence of a TATA motif or binding sites for transcription factor Sp1. To study the mechanism underlying the apparent functional cooperation between YY1 and Sp1, we explored the possibility of protein-protein interactions between these two transcription factors. We found that YY1 and Sp1 can form a physical complex. In addition, we identified domains within YY1 and Sp1 that mediate their interactions with each other. The physical interaction between YY1 and Sp1 may thus form the basis for the functional interplay observed previously.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of $T1$ and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked $T2$ complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how $T1$$T2$ complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the $T1$ (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of $T2$/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/$T1$ related protein, and the $T2$.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with $T1$ on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and $T2$ did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. $T1$ and its counter-receptor $T2$ ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

The POU domains of the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors mediate specific interaction with TBP. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with $T1$ and $T2$. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

Evidence for physical interaction between the zinc-finger transcription factors YY1 and Sp1. Two promoter elements are important for basal-level transcription, the TATA motif typically located 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and the initiator (Inr) element encompassing the start site. The mechanism of how Inr elements work is poorly understood, partly because very few proteins that bind to Inr elements have been identified and isolated. The recently cloned YY1 is such an Inr-binding protein. YY1 is able to direct transcription upon binding to its recognition sequence in vitro. The ability of YY1 to initiate transcription is augmented by the presence of a TATA motif or binding sites for transcription factor Sp1. To study the mechanism underlying the apparent functional cooperation between $T1$ and $T2$, we explored the possibility of protein-protein interactions between these two transcription factors. We found that YY1 and Sp1 can form a physical complex. In addition, we identified domains within YY1 and Sp1 that mediate their interactions with each other. The physical interaction between YY1 and Sp1 may thus form the basis for the functional interplay observed previously.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, $T1$ (hGH) and prolactin ($T2$), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine $T1$ and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit $T2$ on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not $T1$$T2$ but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, $T1$, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor $T2$/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between $T1$ and $T2$ did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that $T1$$T2$ bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

Molecular determinants of the interaction between the C-terminal domain of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide and apolipoprotein E alpha-helices. In a previous work, we predicted and demonstrated that the 29-42-residue fragment of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta peptide) has in vitro capacities close to those of the tilted fragment of viral fusion proteins. We further demonstrated that apolipoprotein E2 and E3 but not apolipoprotein E4 can decrease the fusogenic activity of Abeta(29-42) via a direct interaction. Therefore, we suggested that this fragment is implicated in the neurotoxicity of $T1$ and in the protective effects of $T2$ in Alzheimer's disease. Because structurally related apolipoproteins do not interact with the Abeta C-terminal domain but inhibit viral fusion, we suggested that interactions existing between fusogenic peptides and apolipoproteins are selective and responsible for the inhibition of fusion. In this study, we simulated interactions of all amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins E and A-I with Abeta and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) fusogenic fragments by molecular modeling. We further calculated cross-interactions that do not inhibit fusion in vitro. The results suggest that interactions of hydrophobic residues are the major event to inhibit the fusogenic capacities of Abeta(29-42) and SIV peptides. Selectivity of those interactions is due to the steric complementarity between bulky hydrophobic residues in the fusogenic fragments and hydrophobic residues in the apolipoprotein C-terminal amphipathic helices.

Interaction between ATM protein and c-Abl in response to DNA damage. The gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), designated ATM (for 'AT mutated'), is a member of a family of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like enzymes that are involved in cell-cycle control, meiotic recombination, telomere length monitoring and DNA-damage response. Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective at the G1/S checkpoint after radiation damage. Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase c-Abl are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that $T1$$T2$ are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that ATM might interact with c-Abl in response to radiation damage. Here we show that ATM binds c-Abl constitutively in control cells but not in AT cells. Our results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of c-Abl interacts with a DPAPNPPHFP motif (residues 1,373-1,382) of ATM. The results also reveal that radiation-induction of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is diminished in AT cells. These findings indicate that ATM is involved in the activation of c-Abl by DNA damage and this interaction may in part mediate radiation-induced G1 arrest.

The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation.

We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 ($T1$ ($T2$)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease: review of population association studies. Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Accordingly, a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules $T1$ and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, $T2$ and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1. Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting, the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of $T1$ receptor substrate 1 ($T2$), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the $T1$ and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on $T2$ overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble $T1$/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to $T2$ expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of $T1$ and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked $T2$. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

The POU domains of the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors mediate specific interaction with TBP. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and $T1$$T2$ and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, $T1$ activated $T2$ and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or $T1$ enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between $T2$ and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT ($T1$) and Fas ligand (FasL/$T2$). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by $T1$/$T2$. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

Molecular determinants of the interaction between the C-terminal domain of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide and apolipoprotein E alpha-helices. In a previous work, we predicted and demonstrated that the 29-42-residue fragment of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta peptide) has in vitro capacities close to those of the tilted fragment of viral fusion proteins. We further demonstrated that apolipoprotein E2 and E3 but not $T1$$T2$ and E3 but not apolipoprotein E4 can decrease the fusogenic activity of Abeta(29-42) via a direct interaction. Therefore, we suggested that this fragment is implicated in the neurotoxicity of Abeta and in the protective effects of apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease. Because structurally related apolipoproteins do not interact with the Abeta C-terminal domain but inhibit viral fusion, we suggested that interactions existing between fusogenic peptides and apolipoproteins are selective and responsible for the inhibition of fusion. In this study, we simulated interactions of all amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins E and A-I with Abeta and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) fusogenic fragments by molecular modeling. We further calculated cross-interactions that do not inhibit fusion in vitro. The results suggest that interactions of hydrophobic residues are the major event to inhibit the fusogenic capacities of Abeta(29-42) and SIV peptides. Selectivity of those interactions is due to the steric complementarity between bulky hydrophobic residues in the fusogenic fragments and hydrophobic residues in the apolipoprotein C-terminal amphipathic helices.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation.

Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and $T1$ were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked $T2$ complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind $T1$ ($T2$), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with $T1$$T2$ p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human $T1$ and a second isoform of human $T2$. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/$T1$ chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to $T2$ expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and $T1$, thereby suppressing $T2$- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that $T1$ efficiently associates with Oct1 and $T2$. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/$T1$ (SCYA24) and $T2$ (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. $T1$ does not bind to the $T2$ receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinas$T1$$T2$ represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the $T1$-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the $T2$ pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand ($T1$) are members of the TNF-receptor/$T2$ superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

The rates of commitment to renaturation of $T1$ and $T2$ in the presence of the groE chaperonins. Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which rhodanese and glutamine synthetase (GS) are released from groEL in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human $T1$ second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor ($T2$), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity $T1$$T2$ and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT ($T1$) and Fas ligand ($T2$/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The $T1$ oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the $T2$ tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

Evidence for physical interaction between the zinc-finger transcription factors YY1 and Sp1. Two promoter elements are important for basal-level transcription, the TATA motif typically located 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and the initiator (Inr) element encompassing the start site. The mechanism of how Inr elements work is poorly understood, partly because very few proteins that bind to Inr elements have been identified and isolated. The recently cloned YY1 is such an Inr-binding protein. YY1 is able to direct transcription upon binding to its recognition sequence in vitro. The ability of $T1$ to initiate transcription is augmented by the presence of a TATA motif or binding sites for transcription factor $T2$. To study the mechanism underlying the apparent functional cooperation between YY1 and Sp1, we explored the possibility of protein-protein interactions between these two transcription factors. We found that YY1 and Sp1 can form a physical complex. In addition, we identified domains within YY1 and Sp1 that mediate their interactions with each other. The physical interaction between YY1 and Sp1 may thus form the basis for the functional interplay observed previously.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with $T1$ bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with $T2$. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either $T1$/$T2$ or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that $T1$ inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing $T2$- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, $T1$ is yet another functional ligand for $T2$. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the $T1$ ($T2$) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/$T1$$T2$ (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 ($T1$$T2$ (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of $T1$ equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound $T2$, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the $T1$$T2$ (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the $T1$/$T2$ heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. $T1$, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with $T2$ (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine $T1$$T2$. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked $T1$ complexes with $T2$-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Spectrin cagliari. an Ala-->Gly substitution in helix 1 of beta spectrin repeat 17 that severely disrupts the structure and self-association of the erythrocyte spectrin heterodimer. The spectrin tetramer, the principal structural element of the red cell membrane skeleton, is formed by stable head-to-head self-association of two spectrin heterodimers. The self-association site appears to be formed by interactions between helices 1 and 2 of beta spectrin repeat 17 of one dimer with helix 3 of alpha spectrin repeat 1 of the other dimer to form two combined alpha-beta triple-helical segments. The head of the heterodimer appears to involve similar intradimer interactions. We describe the first example of an amino acid substitution in helix 1 of this combined alpha-beta triple-helical segment, which, although relatively minor, profoundly impairs tetramer formation. Strikingly, low angle rotary shadowing electron microscopy of isolated spectrin dimers reveals that this mutation also severely disrupts the head of the heterodimer causing it to be open. Following linkage studies which were most consistent with a beta spectrin gene mutation, a nucleotide change was identified in codon 2018, resulting in an Ala-->Gly substitution in the first helical domain of $T1$$T2$ gene mutation, a nucleotide change was identified in codon 2018, resulting in an Ala-->Gly substitution in the first helical domain of beta spectrin repeat 17. Because glycine is a strong helix breaker, this change is predicted to disrupt the conformation of this helical domain. Our results indicate that this helical domain must play direct roles in the alpha-beta interdimer interactions that form the self-association site of the tetramer and in the alpha-beta intradimer interactions at the head of the heterodimer.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble $T1$/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-$T2$ MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/$T1$$T2$ inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the $T1$$T2$ associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to $T1$ (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to $T2$ have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Cloning of the complete coding region for human $T1$ using the two hybrid system and expression of $T2$ in E. coli. The yeast two hybrid system has been employed to identify cDNAs encoding proteins which interact with the gamma 1 isoform of human protein phosphatase 1. Here we report the isolation of cDNA encoding human protein phosphatase inhibitor. The deduced human sequence of 205 amino acids shows 92% identity to inhibitor 2 from rabbit. Human inhibitor 2 was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The expressed human protein inhibited both native and bacterially expressed PP1, with the same Ki (1 nM) as inhibitor 2 purified from skeletal muscle. A gene or pseudogene for inhibitor 2 may be present near the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of $T1$$T2$ regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of $T1$, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the $T2$.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor ($T1$$T2$ (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the $T1$ neurotrophin receptor and the $T2$, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the TRKB receptor. Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble TRKB by affinity separation and chemical cross-linking. The extracellular domain of the human neurotrophin TRKB receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for $T1$$T2$ receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103-181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342-394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248-398) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343-379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347, Asp354, and Tyr361 are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the TRKB receptor in binding BDNF.

Interaction between ATM protein and c-Abl in response to DNA damage. The gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), designated ATM (for 'AT mutated'), is a member of a family of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like enzymes that are involved in cell-cycle control, meiotic recombination, telomere length monitoring and DNA-damage response. Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective at the G1/S checkpoint after radiation damage. Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase c-Abl are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that ATM might interact with $T1$$T2$ are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that ATM might interact with c-Abl in response to radiation damage. Here we show that ATM binds c-Abl constitutively in control cells but not in AT cells. Our results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of c-Abl interacts with a DPAPNPPHFP motif (residues 1,373-1,382) of ATM. The results also reveal that radiation-induction of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is diminished in AT cells. These findings indicate that ATM is involved in the activation of c-Abl by DNA damage and this interaction may in part mediate radiation-induced G1 arrest.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or $T1$$T2$ but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

The rates of commitment to renaturation of rhodanese and glutamine synthetase in the presence of the groE chaperonins. Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which $T1$ and glutamine synthetase ($T2$) are released from groEL in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The $T1$ oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of $T2$ and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in $T1$ involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to $T2$ have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone ($T1$) and $T2$ (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of $T1$ with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of $T2$ on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained $T1$ binding equivalent to $T2$, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same $T1$ residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates $T2$ by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of $T1$ with HVEM/$T2$ and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease: review of population association studies. Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Accordingly, a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules tumour necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and $T1$$T2$ and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1. Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting, the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and $T1$$T2$ inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or $T1$ is directly recruited to the ligand-activated $T2$ by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-$T1$ complex may contribute to the activation of the $T2$ pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 ($T1$) and eotaxin-3 ($T2$) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. $T1$ binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the $T2$ and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble $T1$/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of $T2$ to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or $T1$$T2$ also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked $T1$-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked $T2$. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of $T1$, utrophin/$T2$ related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

Evidence for physical interaction between the zinc-finger transcription factors YY1 and Sp1. Two promoter elements are important for basal-level transcription, the TATA motif typically located 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and the initiator (Inr) element encompassing the start site. The mechanism of how Inr elements work is poorly understood, partly because very few proteins that bind to Inr elements have been identified and isolated. The recently cloned $T1$ is such an $T2$. YY1 is able to direct transcription upon binding to its recognition sequence in vitro. The ability of YY1 to initiate transcription is augmented by the presence of a TATA motif or binding sites for transcription factor Sp1. To study the mechanism underlying the apparent functional cooperation between YY1 and Sp1, we explored the possibility of protein-protein interactions between these two transcription factors. We found that YY1 and Sp1 can form a physical complex. In addition, we identified domains within YY1 and Sp1 that mediate their interactions with each other. The physical interaction between YY1 and Sp1 may thus form the basis for the functional interplay observed previously.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and $T1$ ($T2$) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not $T1$$T2$ but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/$T1$$T2$/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

The POU domains of the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors mediate specific interaction with TBP. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the $T1$ component of the $T2$ factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the $T1$ receptor ($T2$) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either $T1$ or $T2$ enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease: review of population association studies. Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Accordingly, a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules tumour necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist ($T1$$T2$ and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1. Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting, the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the TRKB receptor. Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble TRKB by affinity separation and chemical cross-linking. The extracellular domain of the human neurotrophin TRKB receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103-181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342-394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248-398) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343-379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347, Asp354, and Tyr361 are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the $T1$ in binding $T2$.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and $T1$$T2$ and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/$T1$$T2$/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the $T1$$T2$, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of $T1$ equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to $T2$, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits $T1$/$T2$ interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for $T1$/eotaxin-2 ($T2$) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and $T1$ co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that $T2$ did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and $T1$ are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human $T2$ has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of $T1$$T2$ inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

$T1$ stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of $T2$ substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Evidence for physical interaction between the zinc-finger transcription factors YY1 and Sp1. Two promoter elements are important for basal-level transcription, the TATA motif typically located 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and the initiator (Inr) element encompassing the start site. The mechanism of how Inr elements work is poorly understood, partly because very few proteins that bind to Inr elements have been identified and isolated. The recently cloned YY1 is such an Inr-binding protein. YY1 is able to direct transcription upon binding to its recognition sequence in vitro. The ability of YY1 to initiate transcription is augmented by the presence of a TATA motif or binding sites for transcription factor Sp1. To study the mechanism underlying the apparent functional cooperation between YY1 and Sp1, we explored the possibility of protein-protein interactions between these two transcription factors. We found that YY1 and Sp1 can form a physical complex. In addition, we identified domains within YY1 and Sp1 that mediate their interactions with each other. The physical interaction between $T1$ and $T2$ may thus form the basis for the functional interplay observed previously.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the $T1$$T2$ binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

The POU domains of the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors mediate specific interaction with TBP. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as $T1$ can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and $T2$ co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in $T1$ involved in binding to $T2$ (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Molecular determinants of the interaction between the C-terminal domain of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide and apolipoprotein E alpha-helices. In a previous work, we predicted and demonstrated that the 29-42-residue fragment of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta peptide) has in vitro capacities close to those of the tilted fragment of viral fusion proteins. We further demonstrated that apolipoprotein E2 and E3 but not apolipoprotein E4 can decrease the fusogenic activity of Abeta(29-42) via a direct interaction. Therefore, we suggested that this fragment is implicated in the neurotoxicity of Abeta and in the protective effects of apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease. Because structurally related apolipoproteins do not interact with the Abeta C-terminal domain but inhibit viral fusion, we suggested that interactions existing between fusogenic peptides and apolipoproteins are selective and responsible for the inhibition of fusion. In this study, we simulated interactions of all amphipathic helices of $T1$ and A-I with $T2$ and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) fusogenic fragments by molecular modeling. We further calculated cross-interactions that do not inhibit fusion in vitro. The results suggest that interactions of hydrophobic residues are the major event to inhibit the fusogenic capacities of Abeta(29-42) and SIV peptides. Selectivity of those interactions is due to the steric complementarity between bulky hydrophobic residues in the fusogenic fragments and hydrophobic residues in the apolipoprotein C-terminal amphipathic helices.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of $T1$ and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of $T2$ undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for $T1$/eotaxin-2 ($T2$) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. $T1$ does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on $T2$ overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that $T1$ may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the $T2$.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either $T1$/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific $T2$ promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either $T1$ or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and $T2$ did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Evidence for physical interaction between the zinc-finger transcription factors YY1 and Sp1. Two promoter elements are important for basal-level transcription, the TATA motif typically located 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and the initiator (Inr) element encompassing the start site. The mechanism of how Inr elements work is poorly understood, partly because very few proteins that bind to Inr elements have been identified and isolated. The recently cloned YY1 is such an Inr-binding protein. YY1 is able to direct transcription upon binding to its recognition sequence in vitro. The ability of YY1 to initiate transcription is augmented by the presence of a TATA motif or binding sites for transcription factor Sp1. To study the mechanism underlying the apparent functional cooperation between YY1 and Sp1, we explored the possibility of protein-protein interactions between these two transcription factors. We found that YY1 and Sp1 can form a physical complex. In addition, we identified domains within $T1$ and $T2$ that mediate their interactions with each other. The physical interaction between YY1 and Sp1 may thus form the basis for the functional interplay observed previously.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of $T1$ amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the $T2$ cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked $T1$-receptor complexes with $T2$-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the $T1$$T2$ (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin ($T1$$T2$ (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the $T1$ (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by $T2$ in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/$T1$$T2$) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

The POU domains of the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors mediate specific interaction with TBP. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous $T1$ and the lymphoid-specific $T2$ transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and $T1$ are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like $T2$, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the TRKB receptor. Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble TRKB by affinity separation and chemical cross-linking. The extracellular domain of the human $T1$ expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for brain-derived neurotrophic factor ($T2$). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103-181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342-394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248-398) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343-379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347, Asp354, and Tyr361 are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the TRKB receptor in binding BDNF.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/$T1$ ($T2$) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated $T1$ in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine $T2$. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like $T1$, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, $T2$/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

A potential interaction of $T1$ and trkA $T2$ receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for $T1$/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and $T2$ (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

Interaction between ATM protein and c-Abl in response to DNA damage. The gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), designated ATM (for 'AT mutated'), is a member of a family of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like enzymes that are involved in cell-cycle control, meiotic recombination, telomere length monitoring and DNA-damage response. Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective at the G1/S checkpoint after radiation damage. Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase c-Abl are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that ATM might interact with c-Abl in response to radiation damage. Here we show that ATM binds c-Abl constitutively in control cells but not in AT cells. Our results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of c-Abl interacts with a DPAPNPPHFP motif (residues 1,373-1,382) of ATM. The results also reveal that radiation-induction of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is diminished in AT cells. These findings indicate that $T1$ is involved in the activation of $T2$ by DNA damage and this interaction may in part mediate radiation-induced G1 arrest.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific $T1$$T2$ or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

$T1$ recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the $T2$ receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/$T1$ and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing $T2$- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Molecular determinants of the interaction between the C-terminal domain of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide and apolipoprotein E alpha-helices. In a previous work, we predicted and demonstrated that the 29-42-residue fragment of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta peptide) has in vitro capacities close to those of the tilted fragment of viral fusion proteins. We further demonstrated that $T1$ and E3 but not apolipoprotein E4 can decrease the fusogenic activity of $T2$(29-42) via a direct interaction. Therefore, we suggested that this fragment is implicated in the neurotoxicity of Abeta and in the protective effects of apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease. Because structurally related apolipoproteins do not interact with the Abeta C-terminal domain but inhibit viral fusion, we suggested that interactions existing between fusogenic peptides and apolipoproteins are selective and responsible for the inhibition of fusion. In this study, we simulated interactions of all amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins E and A-I with Abeta and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) fusogenic fragments by molecular modeling. We further calculated cross-interactions that do not inhibit fusion in vitro. The results suggest that interactions of hydrophobic residues are the major event to inhibit the fusogenic capacities of Abeta(29-42) and SIV peptides. Selectivity of those interactions is due to the steric complementarity between bulky hydrophobic residues in the fusogenic fragments and hydrophobic residues in the apolipoprotein C-terminal amphipathic helices.

Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease: review of population association studies. Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Accordingly, a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules tumour necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and $T1$$T2$ and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1. Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting, the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 ($T1$), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the $T2$. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human $T1$$T2$), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as $T1$,is directly associated with $T2$ (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the $T1$$T2$ may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that $T1$ inactivates $T2$ by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the $T1$$T2$) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced $T1$$T2$-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

The T-cell antigen $T1$ acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase $T2$. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Interaction between ATM protein and c-Abl in response to DNA damage. The gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), designated ATM (for 'AT mutated'), is a member of a family of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like enzymes that are involved in cell-cycle control, meiotic recombination, telomere length monitoring and DNA-damage response. Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective at the G1/S checkpoint after radiation damage. Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase c-Abl are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that ATM might interact with c-Abl in response to radiation damage. Here we show that ATM binds c-Abl constitutively in control cells but not in AT cells. Our results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of $T1$ interacts with a DPAPNPPHFP motif (residues 1,373-1,382) of $T2$. The results also reveal that radiation-induction of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is diminished in AT cells. These findings indicate that ATM is involved in the activation of c-Abl by DNA damage and this interaction may in part mediate radiation-induced G1 arrest.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and $T1$ co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport $T2$ to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The $T1$ and hPRL receptors ($T2$ and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Mechanism of CDK activation revealed by the structure of a cyclinA-CDK2 complex. The crystal structure of the human cyclinA-$T1$ ($T2$)-ATP complex has been determined at 2.3 A resolution. CyclinA binds to one side of CDK2's catalytic cleft, inducing large conformational changes in its PSTAIRE helix and T-loop. These changes activate the kinase by realigning active site residues and relieving the steric blockade at the entrance of the catalytic cleft.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. $T1$ binding by $T2$ is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, $T1$, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/$T2$. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, $T1$/dystrophin related protein, and the $T2$.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for $T1$/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed $T2$. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

Regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis by activin .The aim of this review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which activin A modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Activin A, a member of the $T1$$T2$, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily, has various effects on diverse biological systems, including cell growth inhibition in many cell types. However, the mechanism(s) by which activin exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood. This review highlights activin's effects on activin receptors and signaling pathway, modulation of activin signaling, and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by activin. Based on the experiences of all the authors, we emphasized cell cycle inhibitors such as p16 and p21 and regulators of apoptosis such as p53 and members of the bcl-2 family. Aside from activin's inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis, other newly developed methods for molecular studies of apoptosis by activin were briefly presented that support the role of activin as an inhibitor of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. These methods include subtractive hybridization based on covalent bonding, a simple and accurate means to determine molecular profile of as few as 20 cells based on an RNA-PCR approach, and a messenger RNA-antisense DNA interference phenomenon (D-RNAi), resulting in a long-term gene knockout effects.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to $T1$, maintained $T2$ binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Two distinct and independent sites on IL-6 trigger gp 130 dimer formation and signalling. The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit $T1$ form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit $T2$ on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of $T1$ with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing $T2$- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis by activin .The aim of this review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which activin A modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Activin A, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily, has various effects on diverse biological systems, including cell growth inhibition in many cell types. However, the mechanism(s) by which activin exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood. This review highlights activin's effects on activin receptors and signaling pathway, modulation of activin signaling, and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by activin. Based on the experiences of all the authors, we emphasized cell cycle inhibitors such as $T1$ and $T2$ and regulators of apoptosis such as p53 and members of the bcl-2 family. Aside from activin's inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis, other newly developed methods for molecular studies of apoptosis by activin were briefly presented that support the role of activin as an inhibitor of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. These methods include subtractive hybridization based on covalent bonding, a simple and accurate means to determine molecular profile of as few as 20 cells based on an RNA-PCR approach, and a messenger RNA-antisense DNA interference phenomenon (D-RNAi), resulting in a long-term gene knockout effects.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/$T1$$T2$/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

Molecular determinants of the interaction between the C-terminal domain of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide and apolipoprotein E alpha-helices. In a previous work, we predicted and demonstrated that the 29-42-residue fragment of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta peptide) has in vitro capacities close to those of the tilted fragment of viral fusion proteins. We further demonstrated that apolipoprotein E2 and E3 but not $T1$ can decrease the fusogenic activity of $T2$(29-42) via a direct interaction. Therefore, we suggested that this fragment is implicated in the neurotoxicity of Abeta and in the protective effects of apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease. Because structurally related apolipoproteins do not interact with the Abeta C-terminal domain but inhibit viral fusion, we suggested that interactions existing between fusogenic peptides and apolipoproteins are selective and responsible for the inhibition of fusion. In this study, we simulated interactions of all amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins E and A-I with Abeta and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) fusogenic fragments by molecular modeling. We further calculated cross-interactions that do not inhibit fusion in vitro. The results suggest that interactions of hydrophobic residues are the major event to inhibit the fusogenic capacities of Abeta(29-42) and SIV peptides. Selectivity of those interactions is due to the steric complementarity between bulky hydrophobic residues in the fusogenic fragments and hydrophobic residues in the apolipoprotein C-terminal amphipathic helices.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of $T1$$T2$ as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. $T1$ also activated $T2$ in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the $T1$$T2$ neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like $T1$, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/$T2$ related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease: review of population association studies. Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Accordingly, a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules tumour necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), $T1$$T2$ and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1. Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting, the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the $T1$$T2$ and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the $T1$ receptor, but $T2$ binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/$T1$ chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of $T2$ to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

The rates of commitment to renaturation of rhodanese and glutamine synthetase in the presence of the groE chaperonins. Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which rhodanese and glutamine synthetase (GS) are released from groEL in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. $T1$ and $T2$ were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of $T1$$T2$ stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease: review of population association studies. Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Accordingly, a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules tumour necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and $T1$$T2$), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1. Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting, the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced $T1$$T2$ but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-$T1$$T2$ molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and $T1$ ($T2$/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: $T1$ to chromosome 16q22-23 and $T2$ to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the $T1$ transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/$T2$. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

Regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis by activin .The aim of this review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which activin A modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Activin A, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily, has various effects on diverse biological systems, including cell growth inhibition in many cell types. However, the mechanism(s) by which activin exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood. This review highlights activin's effects on activin receptors and signaling pathway, modulation of activin signaling, and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by activin. Based on the experiences of all the authors, we emphasized cell cycle inhibitors such as p16 and p21 and regulators of apoptosis such as $T1$$T2$ and regulators of apoptosis such as p53 and members of the bcl-2 family. Aside from activin's inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis, other newly developed methods for molecular studies of apoptosis by activin were briefly presented that support the role of activin as an inhibitor of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. These methods include subtractive hybridization based on covalent bonding, a simple and accurate means to determine molecular profile of as few as 20 cells based on an RNA-PCR approach, and a messenger RNA-antisense DNA interference phenomenon (D-RNAi), resulting in a long-term gene knockout effects.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the $T1$ tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of $T2$ and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and $T1$$T2$ (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the $T1$ receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on $T2$ overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Interaction between ATM protein and c-Abl in response to DNA damage. The gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), designated $T1$ (for '$T2$'), is a member of a family of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like enzymes that are involved in cell-cycle control, meiotic recombination, telomere length monitoring and DNA-damage response. Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective at the G1/S checkpoint after radiation damage. Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase c-Abl are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that ATM might interact with c-Abl in response to radiation damage. Here we show that ATM binds c-Abl constitutively in control cells but not in AT cells. Our results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of c-Abl interacts with a DPAPNPPHFP motif (residues 1,373-1,382) of ATM. The results also reveal that radiation-induction of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is diminished in AT cells. These findings indicate that ATM is involved in the activation of c-Abl by DNA damage and this interaction may in part mediate radiation-induced G1 arrest.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/$T1$$T2$/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/$T1$ and $T2$, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the $T1$$T2$ revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, $T1$ activated Stat1 and $T2$ and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)$T1$$T2$ competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. $T1$ does not bind to the hGH receptor, but $T2$ binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap.

Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the TRKB receptor. Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble TRKB by affinity separation and chemical cross-linking. The extracellular domain of the human $T1$ expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for $T2$ (BDNF). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103-181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342-394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248-398) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343-379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347, Asp354, and Tyr361 are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the TRKB receptor in binding BDNF.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that $T1$ and $T2$ co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the $T1$$T2$. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the $T1$ (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to $T2$. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Interaction between ATM protein and c-Abl in response to DNA damage. The gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), designated ATM (for 'AT mutated'), is a member of a family of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like enzymes that are involved in cell-cycle control, meiotic recombination, telomere length monitoring and DNA-damage response. Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective at the G1/S checkpoint after radiation damage. Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase c-Abl are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that ATM might interact with c-Abl in response to radiation damage. Here we show that $T1$ binds $T2$ constitutively in control cells but not in AT cells. Our results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of c-Abl interacts with a DPAPNPPHFP motif (residues 1,373-1,382) of ATM. The results also reveal that radiation-induction of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is diminished in AT cells. These findings indicate that ATM is involved in the activation of c-Abl by DNA damage and this interaction may in part mediate radiation-induced G1 arrest.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of $T1$ equivalent to TrkA, maintained $T2$ binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of $T1$ equivalent to $T2$, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and $T1$, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on $T2$ overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that $T1$ specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator ($T2$)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that $T1$ and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that $T2$ did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of $T1$ will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other $T2$-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while $T1$ inhibited the $T2$ promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk ($T1$$T2$, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated $T1$$T2$ by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis by activin .The aim of this review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which activin A modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Activin A, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily, has various effects on diverse biological systems, including cell growth inhibition in many cell types. However, the mechanism(s) by which activin exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood. This review highlights activin's effects on activin receptors and signaling pathway, modulation of activin signaling, and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by activin. Based on the experiences of all the authors, we emphasized cell cycle inhibitors such as p16 and p21 and regulators of apoptosis such as p53 and members of the $T1$$T2$ and p21 and regulators of apoptosis such as p53 and members of the bcl-2 family. Aside from activin's inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis, other newly developed methods for molecular studies of apoptosis by activin were briefly presented that support the role of activin as an inhibitor of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. These methods include subtractive hybridization based on covalent bonding, a simple and accurate means to determine molecular profile of as few as 20 cells based on an RNA-PCR approach, and a messenger RNA-antisense DNA interference phenomenon (D-RNAi), resulting in a long-term gene knockout effects.

Interaction between ATM protein and c-Abl in response to DNA damage. The gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), designated ATM (for 'AT mutated'), is a member of a family of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like enzymes that are involved in cell-cycle control, meiotic recombination, telomere length monitoring and DNA-damage response. Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective at the G1/S checkpoint after radiation damage. Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase c-Abl are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that $T1$ might interact with $T2$ in response to radiation damage. Here we show that ATM binds c-Abl constitutively in control cells but not in AT cells. Our results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of c-Abl interacts with a DPAPNPPHFP motif (residues 1,373-1,382) of ATM. The results also reveal that radiation-induction of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is diminished in AT cells. These findings indicate that ATM is involved in the activation of c-Abl by DNA damage and this interaction may in part mediate radiation-induced G1 arrest.

In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase $T1$ and can act as a substrate for $T2$. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-$T1$$T2$ binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of $T1$, $T2$/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the $T1$/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the $T2$ receptor.

CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-$T1$ MAb to inhibit the binding of $T2$ to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released $T1$$T2$ on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that $T1$ stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the $T2$. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained $T1$ binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with $T2$. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in $T1$$T2$ to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 ($T1$$T2$ (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Interactions between $T1$ and the $T2$. Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble TRKB by affinity separation and chemical cross-linking. The extracellular domain of the human neurotrophin TRKB receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103-181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342-394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248-398) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343-379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347, Asp354, and Tyr361 are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the TRKB receptor in binding BDNF.

The rates of commitment to renaturation of rhodanese and glutamine synthetase in the presence of the groE chaperonins. Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which rhodanese and glutamine synthetase (GS) are released from groEL in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of $T1$ to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for $T2$ (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the $T1$ transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor $T2$/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

The POU domains of the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors mediate specific interaction with TBP. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as $T1$ can be co-precipitated with $T2$ from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease: review of population association studies. Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Accordingly, a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules tumour necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta, transforming growth factors (TGF) beta1 and 2, $T1$$T2$ and 2, interleukin (IL) 1 and its receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), CD14 (the receptor for lipopolysaccharide), P and E selectins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1. Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting, the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of $T1$ (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the $T2$. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of $T1$ and $T2$ receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to $T1$, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with $T2$. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. $T1$ binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk ($T2$) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor $T1$ ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/$T2$ superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

The POU domains of the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors mediate specific interaction with TBP. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of $T1$ and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of $T2$ are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in $T1$ involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in $T2$ involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine $T1$ were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for $T2$ or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that $T1$ specifically binds two cellular ligands, $T2$ (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of $T1$ as a $T2$ ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. $T1$ binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the $T2$ neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the TRKB receptor. Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble TRKB by affinity separation and chemical cross-linking. The extracellular domain of the human neurotrophin TRKB receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103-181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342-394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248-398) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343-379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347, Asp354, and Tyr361 are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the $T1$$T2$ in binding BDNF.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 ($T1$), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the $T2$ receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Characterization of $T1$ binding to human $T2$ on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis by activin .The aim of this review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which activin A modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Activin A, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily, has various effects on diverse biological systems, including cell growth inhibition in many cell types. However, the mechanism(s) by which activin exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood. This review highlights activin's effects on activin receptors and signaling pathway, modulation of activin signaling, and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by activin. Based on the experiences of all the authors, we emphasized cell cycle inhibitors such as p16 and p21 and regulators of apoptosis such as $T1$ and members of the $T2$ family. Aside from activin's inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis, other newly developed methods for molecular studies of apoptosis by activin were briefly presented that support the role of activin as an inhibitor of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. These methods include subtractive hybridization based on covalent bonding, a simple and accurate means to determine molecular profile of as few as 20 cells based on an RNA-PCR approach, and a messenger RNA-antisense DNA interference phenomenon (D-RNAi), resulting in a long-term gene knockout effects.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/$T1$$T2$ complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.

In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. $T1$ also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine $T2$ receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as $T1$,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase ($T2$) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like $T1$, human $T2$ has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

The POU domains of the Oct1 and $T1$ transcription factors mediate specific interaction with $T2$. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of $T1$ bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of $T2$ revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/$T1$ G protein-coupled receptor and the $T2$ receptor.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either $T1$/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor $T2$. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but $T1$ binds to both the hGHR and $T2$, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/$T1$ chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-$T2$ MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-$T1$$T2$ and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired $T1$$T2$ acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of $T1$ but not for $T2$ or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both $T1$$T2$ receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, $T1$/$T2$, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor $T1$$T2$ or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/$T1$ complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/$T2$ ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and $T1$ were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with $T2$-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both $T1$$T2$ triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, $T1$ ($T2$) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

The POU domains of the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors mediate specific interaction with TBP. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with $T1$ from co-transfected Cos1 cells and $T2$ co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ($T1$$T2$ stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated $T1$$T2$ but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the TRKB receptor. Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble TRKB by affinity separation and chemical cross-linking. The extracellular domain of the human $T1$$T2$ receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103-181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342-394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248-398) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343-379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347, Asp354, and Tyr361 are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the TRKB receptor in binding BDNF.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the $T1$$T2$ neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as $T1$$T2$, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

The rates of commitment to renaturation of rhodanese and glutamine synthetase in the presence of the groE chaperonins. Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which $T1$ and $T2$ (GS) are released from groEL in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

Characterization of the $T1$ binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-$T2$ antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin ($T1$$T2$) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ($T1$$T2$ (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and $T1$ interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the $T2$.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in $T1$ involved in binding to $T2$ have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, $T1$ (herpes virus entry mediator ($T2$)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that $T1$ was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either $T2$ or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor $T1$ ($T2$) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44).

Mechanism of CDK activation revealed by the structure of a $T1$-$T2$ complex. The crystal structure of the human cyclinA-cyclin-dependent kinase2 (CDK2)-ATP complex has been determined at 2.3 A resolution. CyclinA binds to one side of CDK2's catalytic cleft, inducing large conformational changes in its PSTAIRE helix and T-loop. These changes activate the kinase by realigning active site residues and relieving the steric blockade at the entrance of the catalytic cleft.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to $T1$$T2$, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/$T1$ complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of $T2$/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the $T1$ alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the $T2$ cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The $T1$ POU domain, which is highly homologous to the $T2$ POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and $T1$ interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/$T2$, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-$T1$ complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by $T2$. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not $T1$ or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated $T2$ by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and $T1$$T2$) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Crystal structure of the soluble human 55 kd TNF receptor-human TNF beta complex: implications for TNF receptor activation. The X-ray crystal structure of the complex of the extracellular domain of the human 55 kd tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor with human TNF beta has been determined at 2.85 A resolution. The complex has three receptor molecules bound symmetrically to one TNF beta trimer. The receptor fragment, a very elongated end to end assembly of four similar folding domains, binds in the groove between two adjacent TNF beta subunits. The structure of the complex defines the orientation of the ligand with respect to the cell membrane and provides a model for TNF receptor activation. The novel fold of the TNF receptor structure is likely to be representative of the nerve growth factor ($T1$$T2$ (NGF)/TNF receptor family as a whole.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. $T1$ competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to $T2$-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. $T1$ associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/$T2$ complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 ($T1$) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed $T2$. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble $T1$$T2$ system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the $T1$ and the $T2$, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. $T1$ does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and $T2$, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by $T1$$T2$ and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Spectrin cagliari. an Ala-->Gly substitution in helix 1 of beta spectrin repeat 17 that severely disrupts the structure and self-association of the erythrocyte spectrin heterodimer. The spectrin tetramer, the principal structural element of the red cell membrane skeleton, is formed by stable head-to-head self-association of two spectrin heterodimers. The self-association site appears to be formed by interactions between helices 1 and 2 of $T1$ repeat 17 of one dimer with helix 3 of $T2$ repeat 1 of the other dimer to form two combined alpha-beta triple-helical segments. The head of the heterodimer appears to involve similar intradimer interactions. We describe the first example of an amino acid substitution in helix 1 of this combined alpha-beta triple-helical segment, which, although relatively minor, profoundly impairs tetramer formation. Strikingly, low angle rotary shadowing electron microscopy of isolated spectrin dimers reveals that this mutation also severely disrupts the head of the heterodimer causing it to be open. Following linkage studies which were most consistent with a beta spectrin gene mutation, a nucleotide change was identified in codon 2018, resulting in an Ala-->Gly substitution in the first helical domain of beta spectrin repeat 17. Because glycine is a strong helix breaker, this change is predicted to disrupt the conformation of this helical domain. Our results indicate that this helical domain must play direct roles in the alpha-beta interdimer interactions that form the self-association site of the tetramer and in the alpha-beta intradimer interactions at the head of the heterodimer.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the $T1$ alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of $T2$ amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the ITF-2 transcription factor, ITF-2b, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/$T1$ heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by $T2$/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both $T1$$T2$ triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the $T1$ ($T2$)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and its association with Grb2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of $T1$ receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the $T2$ receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin. Taken together, our results suggest that IRS-1 may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families, such as the gastrin/CCKB G protein-coupled receptor and the insulin receptor.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/$T1$ ($T2$) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of $T1$ bound to the extracellular domain of the $T2$. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of $T1$ to $T2$ expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

A potential interaction of p75 and trkA NGF receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with $T1$-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked $T2$. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine $T1$ receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for $T2$ or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human $T1$ second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind $T2$ (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives. The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/$T1$, and the $T2$.

In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex. The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the $T1$-$T2$ complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.

Molecular determinants of the interaction between the C-terminal domain of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide and apolipoprotein E alpha-helices. In a previous work, we predicted and demonstrated that the 29-42-residue fragment of $T1$ ($T2$) has in vitro capacities close to those of the tilted fragment of viral fusion proteins. We further demonstrated that apolipoprotein E2 and E3 but not apolipoprotein E4 can decrease the fusogenic activity of Abeta(29-42) via a direct interaction. Therefore, we suggested that this fragment is implicated in the neurotoxicity of Abeta and in the protective effects of apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease. Because structurally related apolipoproteins do not interact with the Abeta C-terminal domain but inhibit viral fusion, we suggested that interactions existing between fusogenic peptides and apolipoproteins are selective and responsible for the inhibition of fusion. In this study, we simulated interactions of all amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins E and A-I with Abeta and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) fusogenic fragments by molecular modeling. We further calculated cross-interactions that do not inhibit fusion in vitro. The results suggest that interactions of hydrophobic residues are the major event to inhibit the fusogenic capacities of Abeta(29-42) and SIV peptides. Selectivity of those interactions is due to the steric complementarity between bulky hydrophobic residues in the fusogenic fragments and hydrophobic residues in the apolipoprotein C-terminal amphipathic helices.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the $T1$$T2$ bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding protein-associated factors.

A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. $T1$ inhibited $T2$-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.

Characterization of the CD30L binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti-CD30 antibodies. CD30 and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/TNFalpha superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation. Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed against CD30 and, based on mutual inhibition assays, are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters. However, the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for CD30L is not known. Using a soluble CD30L/CD8alpha chimeric protein, we assessed the ability of anti-CD30 MAb to inhibit the binding of CD30L to CD30 expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line. CD30L binding by CD30 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber-H2, Ber-H8, and HRS-4) as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi-1 and M44). Cluster Group B antibodies, including M67 and Ki-1, do not affect CD30L binding to CD30. The pattern of CD30L binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti-CD30 MAb to trigger CD30 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-CD30L MAb M81 also completely inhibits CD30/CD30L interaction. This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the CD30/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble $T1$$T2$/CD30L system and for designing assays for soluble CD30L.

Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 ($T1$$T2$ (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

The POU domains of the $T1$ and Oct2 transcription factors mediate specific interaction with $T2$. We had previously shown that the ubiquitous Oct1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct2 transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation. We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor. By using several different experimental systems we show that TBP efficiently associates with Oct1 and Oct2. The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and C-terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Oct1 POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from co-transfected Cos1 cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Oct1 from HeLa cells. Co-transfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.

Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)$T1$ to $T2$-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.

The T-cell antigen CD5 acts as a receptor and substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the $T1$ complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of $T2$/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. CD5 interaction with p56lck represents a novel variant of a receptor-kinase complex in which receptor can also serve as substrate. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )

Characterization of adenosine deaminase binding to human CD26 on T cells and its biologic role in immune response. CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV,is directly associated with adenosine deaminase ($T1$$T2$ (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.

Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the TRKB receptor. Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble TRKB by affinity separation and chemical cross-linking. The extracellular domain of the human neurotrophin TRKB receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103-181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342-394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248-398) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343-379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347, Asp354, and Tyr361 are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the $T1$ receptor in binding $T2$.

Mechanism of CDK activation revealed by the structure of a cyclinA-CDK2 complex. The crystal structure of the human $T1$-$T2$ (CDK2)-ATP complex has been determined at 2.3 A resolution. CyclinA binds to one side of CDK2's catalytic cleft, inducing large conformational changes in its PSTAIRE helix and T-loop. These changes activate the kinase by realigning active site residues and relieving the steric blockade at the entrance of the catalytic cleft.

TrkA amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor. Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to $T1$, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound $T2$, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk.

Physical and functional interactions between the transcriptional inhibitors Id3 and ITF-2b. Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the $T1$ transcription factor, $T2$, that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor Id3/HLH462. The interaction was confirmed in vitro, and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells. As expected, overexpression of either Id3/HLH462 or ITF-2b effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase promoter by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. However, when overexpressed simultaneously, ITF-2b and Id3/HLH462 counteracted each other's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition. Moreover, while ITF-2b inhibited the creatine kinase promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site. Further investigation indicated that the ITF-2b/MyoD heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro, and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by Id3/HLH462. Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating (ITF-2a) and inhibitory (ITF-2b) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures, suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process. Taken together, this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix-loop-helix proteins than was previously anticipated.
