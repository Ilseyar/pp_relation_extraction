Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, $T1$, that has no known homolog in Drosophila $T2$ is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants $T1$$T2$ in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Activation of protein kinase C decreases phosphorylation of c-Jun at sites that negatively regulate its DNA-binding activity. In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells, $T1$ is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites, three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase 3 ($T2$). These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227-252). Activation of protein kinase C results in rapid, site-specific dephosphorylation of c-Jun at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased AP-1-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human c-Jun proteins in vitro by GSK-3 decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold. We propose that c-Jun is present in resting cells in a latent, phosphorylated form that can be activated by site-specific dephosphorylation in response to protein kinase C activation.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. $T1$ displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with $T2$ family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Cloning of TRAP, a ligand for CD40 on human T cells. A cDNA clone, designated TRAP (TNF-related activation protein) was isolated from a collection of T cell activation genes. The polypeptide encoded by a mRNA of approx. 2.3 kb is 261 amino acids long with a calculated M(r) of 29.3 kDa. The structural features predict a type II transmembrane protein, but are also compatible with a secreted form. TRAP is highly similar to an identified murine CD40 ligand both at the cDNA (82.8% identity) and the protein (77.4% identity) levels, and related to tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin. Expressed in a murine myeloma, $T1$ was identified as a ligand for CD40 by binding to a soluble $T2$ construct. TRAP mRNA is expressed in a T cell-specific fashion with a maximum at 8 h after stimulation. The TRAP gene is located in the q26.3-q27.1 region of the X chromosome.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein $T1$ and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/$T2$. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed $T1$ mutations disrupt $T2$ binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor ($T1$) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and $T2$ were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that $T1$ was comodulated on the T cell surface with $T2$, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the $T1$ receptor ($T2$) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to $T1$$T2$) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit ($T1$) of human $T2$ through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/$T1$$T2$ and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor ($T1$) crucial for binding to both the human $T2$ (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. $T1$ binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to $T2$ mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and $T1$$T2$ family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43).

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain ($T1$) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of $T2$ in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, $T1$ encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and $T2$.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing $T1$$T2$/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the $T1$$T2$ in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing $T1$$T2$ amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. $T1$ contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and $T2$. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. $T1$ is shown to interact with the largest subunit ($T2$) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, $T1$$T2$, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in $T1$ appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the $T2$ pathway.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased $T1$$T2$ (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and $T1$$T2$, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of $T1$ and bFGF to $T2$ were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-$T1$$T2$-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis.

FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction.

Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, $T1$$T2$, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of $T1$ suggested that $T2$ homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human $T1$$T2$ is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor $T1$$T2$ DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of $T1$ and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or $T2$(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Activation of protein kinase C decreases phosphorylation of c-Jun at sites that negatively regulate its DNA-binding activity. In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells, c-Jun is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites, three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227-252). Activation of protein kinase C results in rapid, site-specific dephosphorylation of c-Jun at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased AP-1-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human $T1$ proteins in vitro by $T2$ decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold. We propose that c-Jun is present in resting cells in a latent, phosphorylated form that can be activated by site-specific dephosphorylation in response to protein kinase C activation.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like $T1$$T2$ are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, $T1$, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of $T2$ that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta ($T1$$T2$ and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, $T1$$T2$, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the $T1$$T2$) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Identification of interaction partners for the basic-helix-loop-helix protein E47. Helix-loop-helix proteins constitute a family of transcription factors with the potential to form homo- and hetero-dimers mediated by the helix-loop-helix domain. Oncogenic mutations in such genes can disrupt the equilibrium of protein-protein interactions in the affected cell. In order to assess the biological consequences of such mutations, the full complement of interacting proteins must be known. To identify proteins interacting with the basic-helix-loop-helix domain of the ubiquitously expressed E47 protein, a 'sandwich'-screening procedure was developed which distinguishes between homo- and hetero-oligomers, and specifically excludes the detection of complexes which cannot bind DNA. Nine distinct cDNAs were identified which encode proteins with apparent basic-helix-loop-helix domains, including a novel clone termed eip1 which is distantly related in the basic-helix-loop-helix domain to the Drosophila enhancer-of-split m7 protein. Using epitope-tagging, interaction of E47 basic-helix-loop-helix protein with the eip1 protein encoded by this novel cDNA was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments in COS7 cells. Interaction was also observed in the yeast two-hybrid system. Three cDNAs encoding proteins without basic-helix-loop-helix domains were also found to interact in the sandwich-expression screen. Interactions with human PARP and mouse replication factor 1a were confirmed using glutathione transferase-tagged cDNAs. A cDNA encoding part of the $T1$ protein sequence interacted with the $T2$ basic-helix-loop-helix only when fused to a beta-galactosidase tag.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the $T1$ core domain bound to the $T2$ protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. $T1$ associates with the $T2$ after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit ($T1$) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, $T2$, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-$T1$$T2$ and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing $T1$$T2$ amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Regulation of the $T1$-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the $T2$ protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the $T1$$T2$ (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of $T1$ zeta tyrosine residues and increased $T2$ associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-$T1$) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of $T2$/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of $T1$ that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on $T2$ binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/$T1$$T2$ differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Crystal structure of fibroblast growth factor receptor ectodomain bound to ligand and heparin. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a large family of structurally related proteins with a wide range of physiological and pathological activities. Signal transduction requires association of FGF with its receptor tyrosine kinase (FGFR) and heparan sulphate proteoglycan in a specific complex on the cell surface. Direct involvement of the heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide in the molecular association between FGF and its receptor is essential for biological activity. Although crystal structures of binary complexes of FGF-heparin and FGF-FGFR have been described, the molecular architecture of the FGF signalling complex has not been elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of the FGFR2 ectodomain in a dimeric form that is induced by simultaneous binding to FGF1 and a heparin decasaccharide. The complex is assembled around a central heparin molecule linking two FGF1 ligands into a dimer that bridges between two receptor chains. The asymmetric heparin binding involves contacts with both FGF1 molecules but only one receptor chain. The structure of the $T1$-$T2$-heparin ternary complex provides a structural basis for the essential role of heparan sulphate in FGF signalling.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. $T1$ is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, $T2$, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Structure of the $T1$ tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of $T2$. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/$T1$$T2$ (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of $T1$ possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants $T2$-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Helix-loop-helix proteins constitute a family of transcription factors with the potential to form homo- and hetero-dimers mediated by the helix-loop-helix domain. Oncogenic mutations in such genes can disrupt the equilibrium of protein-protein interactions in the affected cell. In order to assess the biological consequences of such mutations, the full complement of interacting proteins must be known. To identify proteins interacting with the basic-helix-loop-helix domain of the ubiquitously expressed E47 protein, a 'sandwich'-screening procedure was developed which distinguishes between homo- and hetero-oligomers, and specifically excludes the detection of complexes which cannot bind DNA. Nine distinct cDNAs were identified which encode proteins with apparent basic-helix-loop-helix domains, including a novel clone termed eip1 which is distantly related in the basic-helix-loop-helix domain to the Drosophila enhancer-of-split m7 protein. Using epitope-tagging, interaction of $T1$ basic-helix-loop-helix protein with the $T2$ protein encoded by this novel cDNA was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments in COS7 cells. Interaction was also observed in the yeast two-hybrid system. Three cDNAs encoding proteins without basic-helix-loop-helix domains were also found to interact in the sandwich-expression screen. Interactions with human PARP and mouse replication factor 1a were confirmed using glutathione transferase-tagged cDNAs. A cDNA encoding part of the nucleolin protein sequence interacted with the E47 basic-helix-loop-helix only when fused to a beta-galactosidase tag.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human $T1$ through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, $T2$, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and $T1$ to $T2$ were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, phFGFR encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both aFGF and bFGF.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the $T1$$T2$-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and $T1$-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants $T2$-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that $T1$ contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of $T2$ both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and $T1$$T2$ beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the $T1$ binding site on the $T2$ core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with $T1$$T2$ beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, $T1$$T2$, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including $T1$, YY1, USF, $T2$, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel $T1$-binding protein, termed $T2$. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common $T1$ (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced $T2$ binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein $T1$ and the pocket proteins pRb, $T2$ and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:$T1$ binds to the activin type II receptor kinase ($T2$) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta. SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII. SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of $T1$ with the $T2$ receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An $T1$ complex containing mainly $T2$ and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of $T1$ in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of $T2$. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted $T1$$T2$ interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating $T1$$T2$, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I ($T1$) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, $T2$ (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and $T1$. $T2$ displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Cloning of TRAP, a ligand for CD40 on human T cells. A cDNA clone, designated TRAP (TNF-related activation protein) was isolated from a collection of T cell activation genes. The polypeptide encoded by a mRNA of approx. 2.3 kb is 261 amino acids long with a calculated M(r) of 29.3 kDa. The structural features predict a type II transmembrane protein, but are also compatible with a secreted form. TRAP is highly similar to an identified murine CD40 ligand both at the cDNA (82.8% identity) and the protein (77.4% identity) levels, and related to tumor necrosis factor/$T1$$T2$ is highly similar to an identified murine CD40 ligand both at the cDNA (82.8% identity) and the protein (77.4% identity) levels, and related to tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin. Expressed in a murine myeloma, TRAP was identified as a ligand for CD40 by binding to a soluble CD40 construct. TRAP mRNA is expressed in a T cell-specific fashion with a maximum at 8 h after stimulation. The TRAP gene is located in the q26.3-q27.1 region of the X chromosome.

In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma.

After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of $T1$ results in the release of $T2$, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, $T1$, which binds $T2$ and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Type II regulatory subunit (RII) of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase interaction with A-kinase anchor proteins requires isoleucines 3 and 5. Compartmentalization of the type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is maintained by association of the regulatory subunit (RII) with A-Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). In previous studies (Scott, J. D., Stofko, R. E., McDonald, J. R., Comer, J. D., Vitalis, E. A., and Mangili J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21561-21566) we have shown that dimerization of $T1$ was required for interaction with the cytoskeletal component $T2$. In this report we show that the localization and dimerization domains of RII alpha are contained within the first thirty residues of each RII protomer. RII des-5 (an amino-terminal deletion mutant lacking residues 1-5) was unable to bind AKAPs but retained the ability to dimerize. RII alpha I3A,I5A (a mutant where isoleucines 3 and 5 were replaced with alanine) was unable to bind a variety of AKAPs. Mutation of both isoleucines decreased AKAP binding without affecting dimerization, cAMP binding, or the overall secondary structure of the protein. Measurement of RII alpha I3A,I5A interaction with the human thyroid AKAP, Ht 31, by two independent methods suggests that mutation of isoleucines 3 and 5 decreases affinity by at least 6-fold. Therefore, we propose that two isoleucine side chains on each RII protomer are principle sites of contact with the conserved amphipathic helix binding domain on AKAPs.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that $T1$, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both $T2$ beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing $T1$$T2$ containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with $T1$ and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to $T2$ and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. $T1$ is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including $T2$, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the $T1$ (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/$T2$. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate $T1$ function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for $T2$/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Expression of glucocorticoid receptors and cyclooxygenase-2 in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients. Glucocorticoid treatment has been widely used to suppress inflammatory and immune responses. However, from a clinical point of view, its efficacy in the treatment of nasal polyposis seems to vary individually from patient to patient. In the present study, we examined the presence of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the nasal polyps of nonallergic patients as compared with normal controls. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed the presence of both GR messenger RNA and COX-2 messenger RNA expression in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients, as well as in normal nasal mucosa from controls. Consistent with this finding, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that GRs and COX-2 were labeled in both tissues. In nasal polyps, GR labeling was associated with the cytoplasm and nucleus of surface mucosa, submucosal glands, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells. Importantly, COX-2 labeling was seen in the cytoplasm of surface mucosa, submucosal glands, and the vascular wall in nasal polyps. In contrast, in normal nasal tissues, COX-2 labeling was only found in the vascular wall, and the expression was weaker--a finding demonstrating that COX-2 is upregulated in nasal polyps. Therefore, 1) the presence of GRs and COX-2 in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients, as well as upregulation of $T1$$T2$ in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients, as well as upregulation of COX-2 expression, suggests that inflammation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of nasal polyps; and 2) glucocorticoid could be a potential treatment method for suppressing inflammatory processes.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta($T1$$T2$ with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, $T1$, $T2$, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Regulation of the $T1$-related transcription factor $T2$ by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing $T1$$T2$ containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Type II regulatory subunit (RII) of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase interaction with A-kinase anchor proteins requires isoleucines 3 and 5. Compartmentalization of the type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is maintained by association of the regulatory subunit (RII) with A-Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). In previous studies (Scott, J. D., Stofko, R. E., McDonald, J. R., Comer, J. D., Vitalis, E. A., and Mangili J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21561-21566) we have shown that dimerization of RII alpha was required for interaction with the cytoskeletal component microtubule-associated protein 2. In this report we show that the localization and dimerization domains of RII alpha are contained within the first thirty residues of each RII protomer. RII des-5 (an amino-terminal deletion mutant lacking residues 1-5) was unable to bind AKAPs but retained the ability to dimerize. RII alpha I3A,I5A (a mutant where isoleucines 3 and 5 were replaced with alanine) was unable to bind a variety of AKAPs. Mutation of both isoleucines decreased AKAP binding without affecting dimerization, cAMP binding, or the overall secondary structure of the protein. Measurement of $T1$ I3A,I5A interaction with the human thyroid AKAP, $T2$, by two independent methods suggests that mutation of isoleucines 3 and 5 decreases affinity by at least 6-fold. Therefore, we propose that two isoleucine side chains on each RII protomer are principle sites of contact with the conserved amphipathic helix binding domain on AKAPs.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the $T1$ receptor (IR) and the $T2$ receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-$T1$$T2$-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the $T1$$T2$ suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Cloning of TRAP, a ligand for CD40 on human T cells. A cDNA clone, designated TRAP (TNF-related activation protein) was isolated from a collection of T cell activation genes. The polypeptide encoded by a mRNA of approx. 2.3 kb is 261 amino acids long with a calculated M(r) of 29.3 kDa. The structural features predict a type II transmembrane protein, but are also compatible with a secreted form. TRAP is highly similar to an identified murine $T1$ both at the cDNA (82.8% identity) and the protein (77.4% identity) levels, and related to tumor necrosis factor/$T2$. Expressed in a murine myeloma, TRAP was identified as a ligand for CD40 by binding to a soluble CD40 construct. TRAP mRNA is expressed in a T cell-specific fashion with a maximum at 8 h after stimulation. The TRAP gene is located in the q26.3-q27.1 region of the X chromosome.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, $T1$, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-$T2$ and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that $T1$ interacts with another signaling protein, $T2$. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts ($T1$$T2$/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex).

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. $T1$ is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, $T2$, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Coassociation of $T1$ (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with $T2$ on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

Expression of glucocorticoid receptors and cyclooxygenase-2 in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients. Glucocorticoid treatment has been widely used to suppress inflammatory and immune responses. However, from a clinical point of view, its efficacy in the treatment of nasal polyposis seems to vary individually from patient to patient. In the present study, we examined the presence of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and cyclooxygenase-2 ($T1$$T2$ (COX-2) in the nasal polyps of nonallergic patients as compared with normal controls. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed the presence of both GR messenger RNA and COX-2 messenger RNA expression in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients, as well as in normal nasal mucosa from controls. Consistent with this finding, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that GRs and COX-2 were labeled in both tissues. In nasal polyps, GR labeling was associated with the cytoplasm and nucleus of surface mucosa, submucosal glands, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells. Importantly, COX-2 labeling was seen in the cytoplasm of surface mucosa, submucosal glands, and the vascular wall in nasal polyps. In contrast, in normal nasal tissues, COX-2 labeling was only found in the vascular wall, and the expression was weaker--a finding demonstrating that COX-2 is upregulated in nasal polyps. Therefore, 1) the presence of GRs and COX-2 in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients, as well as upregulation of COX-2 expression, suggests that inflammation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of nasal polyps; and 2) glucocorticoid could be a potential treatment method for suppressing inflammatory processes.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with $T1$$T2$, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, $T1$$T2$, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor $T1$ by binding to the $T2$ protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, $T1$$T2$, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

The mitogenic effects of the B beta chain of fibrinogen are mediated through cell surface calreticulin. We have previously shown that soluble partially degraded fibrin(ogen) remains in solution after fibrin clot formation and is a potent fibroblast mitogen (Gray, A.J., Bishop, J.E., Reeves J.T., Mecham, R.P., and Laurent, G.J. (1995) Am. J. Cell Mol. Biol. 12, 684-690). Mitogenic sites within the fibrin(ogen) molecule are located on the A alpha and B beta chains of the protein (Gray, A.J., Bishop, J. E., Reeves, J.T., and Laurent, G.J. (1993) J. Cell Sci. 104, 409-413). However, receptor pathways through which mitogenic effects are mediated are unknown. The present study sought to determine the nature of fibrin(ogen) receptors expressed on human fibroblasts which interact with the fibrinogen B beta chain. Receptor complexes were isolated from 125I-surface-labeled fibroblasts and purified on a fibrinogen B beta chain affinity column. Subsequent high performance liquid chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated fibrinogen B beta chain bound specifically to a 60-kDa surface protein. Sequence analysis of the amino terminus of this protein indicated 100% homology to human calreticulin. Immunoprecipitation experiments employing a polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody provided further evidence that the 60-kDa protein isolated in this study was calreticulin. Further, polyclonal antibodies to human calreticulin significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of fibrinogen B beta chain on human fibroblasts. The present study has shown that cell surface $T1$ binds to the $T2$ mediating its mitogenic activity.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the $T1$-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the $T2$ pathway of tumor suppression.

These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or $T1$$T2$ (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing $T1$$T2$ induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for $T1$ signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced $T2$ binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing $T1$$T2$ suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, $T1$, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, $T2$, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit ($T1$) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral $T2$, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

SREBP transcriptional activity is mediated through an interaction with the CREB-binding protein. The sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1 and -2) activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in the cellular uptake and synthesis of cholesterol. Although considerable effort has been exerted to define the events regulating the levels of active SREBP, little is known about the transcriptional cofactors mediating SREBP function. In an unbiased search for potential coactivators of SREBP, we isolated a protein of 265 kD from HeLa cells that directly bound SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. Peptide sequencing and Western blot analysis established that the 265-kD protein was CBP (CREB-binding protein),a recently identified transcriptional coactivator. The putative activation domain of SREBP was shown to bind specifically to amino-terminal domains of recombinant $T1$ and $T2$ (a CBP-related protein). Moreover, transfection studies demonstrated that CBP enhances the ability of SREBP to activate transcription of reporter genes in HeLa cells. Together, these data suggest that CBP mediates SREBP transcriptional activity, thus revealing a new step in the biochemical pathway regulating cholesterol metabolism.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by $T1$$T2$ in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme.

Expression of glucocorticoid receptors and cyclooxygenase-2 in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients. Glucocorticoid treatment has been widely used to suppress inflammatory and immune responses. However, from a clinical point of view, its efficacy in the treatment of nasal polyposis seems to vary individually from patient to patient. In the present study, we examined the presence of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the nasal polyps of nonallergic patients as compared with normal controls. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed the presence of both GR messenger RNA and COX-2 messenger RNA expression in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients, as well as in normal nasal mucosa from controls. Consistent with this finding, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that GRs and COX-2 were labeled in both tissues. In nasal polyps, GR labeling was associated with the cytoplasm and nucleus of surface mucosa, submucosal glands, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells. Importantly, COX-2 labeling was seen in the cytoplasm of surface mucosa, submucosal glands, and the vascular wall in nasal polyps. In contrast, in normal nasal tissues, $T1$ labeling was only found in the vascular wall, and the expression was weaker--a finding demonstrating that $T2$ is upregulated in nasal polyps. Therefore, 1) the presence of GRs and COX-2 in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients, as well as upregulation of COX-2 expression, suggests that inflammation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of nasal polyps; and 2) glucocorticoid could be a potential treatment method for suppressing inflammatory processes.

Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between $T1$ and $T2$ in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit ($T1$) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, $T2$, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, $T1$$T2$, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of $T1$ with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to $T2$. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. $T1$ also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. $T2$ displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-$T1$ complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the $T2$ pathway of tumor suppression.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. $T1$ contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of $T2$ and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

SREBP transcriptional activity is mediated through an interaction with the CREB-binding protein. The sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1 and -2) activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in the cellular uptake and synthesis of cholesterol. Although considerable effort has been exerted to define the events regulating the levels of active SREBP, little is known about the transcriptional cofactors mediating SREBP function. In an unbiased search for potential coactivators of SREBP, we isolated a protein of 265 kD from HeLa cells that directly bound SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. Peptide sequencing and Western blot analysis established that the 265-kD protein was $T1$ ($T2$),a recently identified transcriptional coactivator. The putative activation domain of SREBP was shown to bind specifically to amino-terminal domains of recombinant CBP and p300 (a CBP-related protein). Moreover, transfection studies demonstrated that CBP enhances the ability of SREBP to activate transcription of reporter genes in HeLa cells. Together, these data suggest that CBP mediates SREBP transcriptional activity, thus revealing a new step in the biochemical pathway regulating cholesterol metabolism.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common $T1$ (gammac) for $T2$ signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or $T1$$T2$ beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for $T1$/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for $T2$/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Cloning of TRAP, a ligand for CD40 on human T cells. A cDNA clone, designated TRAP (TNF-related activation protein) was isolated from a collection of T cell activation genes. The polypeptide encoded by a mRNA of approx. 2.3 kb is 261 amino acids long with a calculated M(r) of 29.3 kDa. The structural features predict a type II transmembrane protein, but are also compatible with a secreted form. TRAP is highly similar to an identified murine CD40 ligand both at the cDNA (82.8% identity) and the protein (77.4% identity) levels, and related to tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin. Expressed in a murine myeloma, $T1$ was identified as a ligand for $T2$ by binding to a soluble CD40 construct. TRAP mRNA is expressed in a T cell-specific fashion with a maximum at 8 h after stimulation. The TRAP gene is located in the q26.3-q27.1 region of the X chromosome.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-$T1$) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed $T2$ activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. $T1$ is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral $T2$, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system.

Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator.

Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-$T1$ was capable of precipitating $T2$ from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the $T1$/$T2$ containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, $T1$$T2$ family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the $T1$ (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor ($T2$) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, $T1$$T2$, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the $T1$ protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of $T2$. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of $T1$, abolishes its ability to bind $T2$, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, $T1$, with another SH2-containing protein, $T2$. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of $T1$ from T cell surface induced by anti$T2$ (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of $T1$ that contribute the majority of free energy for $T2$ binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors $T1$ and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with $T2$ family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas $T1$ serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for $T2$ signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in $T1$, analogous to the lpr mutation of $T2$, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for $T1$ or Y950/F for $T2$. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including $T1$, YY1, $T2$, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of $T1$ in allowing enhanced $T2$ binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, $T1$, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and $T2$) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of $T1$$T2$-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing $T1$$T2$ suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of $T1$ possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-$T2$. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that $T1$ may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with $T2$ results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. The $T1$ gene product ($T2$) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

Cloning of TRAP, a ligand for CD40 on human T cells. A cDNA clone, designated TRAP ($T1$$T2$ (TNF-related activation protein) was isolated from a collection of T cell activation genes. The polypeptide encoded by a mRNA of approx. 2.3 kb is 261 amino acids long with a calculated M(r) of 29.3 kDa. The structural features predict a type II transmembrane protein, but are also compatible with a secreted form. TRAP is highly similar to an identified murine CD40 ligand both at the cDNA (82.8% identity) and the protein (77.4% identity) levels, and related to tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin. Expressed in a murine myeloma, TRAP was identified as a ligand for CD40 by binding to a soluble CD40 construct. TRAP mRNA is expressed in a T cell-specific fashion with a maximum at 8 h after stimulation. The TRAP gene is located in the q26.3-q27.1 region of the X chromosome.

Interaction of the $T1$ subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the $T2$ receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

cDNA cloning and expression of a human FGF receptor which binds acidic and basic FGF. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, phFGFR, encoding a human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. phFGFR contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain. Transient expression in COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide, gave rise to two components, representing mature (130 kDa) and precursor (115 kDa) forms of the phFGFR encoded polypeptide, which was denoted hFGFR-1. Crosslinking of iodinated acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both aFGF and bFGF. From Scatchard analyses, the Kd:s for binding of aFGF and bFGF to hFGFR-1 were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM, respectively. Thus, $T1$ encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both $T2$ and bFGF.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, $T1$$T2$, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, $T1$, $T2$, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/$T1$$T2$ (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for $T1$ signaling, it could not replace the function of $T2$ in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing $T1$$T2$, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of $T1$ and fails to bind to $T2$ mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and $T1$$T2$ in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Cloning of $T1$, a ligand for $T2$ on human T cells. A cDNA clone, designated TRAP (TNF-related activation protein) was isolated from a collection of T cell activation genes. The polypeptide encoded by a mRNA of approx. 2.3 kb is 261 amino acids long with a calculated M(r) of 29.3 kDa. The structural features predict a type II transmembrane protein, but are also compatible with a secreted form. TRAP is highly similar to an identified murine CD40 ligand both at the cDNA (82.8% identity) and the protein (77.4% identity) levels, and related to tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin. Expressed in a murine myeloma, TRAP was identified as a ligand for CD40 by binding to a soluble CD40 construct. TRAP mRNA is expressed in a T cell-specific fashion with a maximum at 8 h after stimulation. The TRAP gene is located in the q26.3-q27.1 region of the X chromosome.

SREBP transcriptional activity is mediated through an interaction with the $T1$$T2$. The sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1 and -2) activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in the cellular uptake and synthesis of cholesterol. Although considerable effort has been exerted to define the events regulating the levels of active SREBP, little is known about the transcriptional cofactors mediating SREBP function. In an unbiased search for potential coactivators of SREBP, we isolated a protein of 265 kD from HeLa cells that directly bound SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. Peptide sequencing and Western blot analysis established that the 265-kD protein was CBP (CREB-binding protein),a recently identified transcriptional coactivator. The putative activation domain of SREBP was shown to bind specifically to amino-terminal domains of recombinant CBP and p300 (a CBP-related protein). Moreover, transfection studies demonstrated that CBP enhances the ability of SREBP to activate transcription of reporter genes in HeLa cells. Together, these data suggest that CBP mediates SREBP transcriptional activity, thus revealing a new step in the biochemical pathway regulating cholesterol metabolism.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-$T1$, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-$T2$. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the $T1$$T2$ is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the $T1$ core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of $T2$. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in $T1$ appears to exert a negative control on binding of $T2$ thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described.

The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for $T1$$T2$ differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro $T1$ protein binding activity of $T2$. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human $T1$ TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila $T2$ is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, $T1$$T2$, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the $T1$$T2$ activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in $T1$, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind $T2$, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of $T1$ with the insulin receptor ($T2$) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain ($T1$) for $T2$ signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the $T1$ binding site in $T2$ created antagonists of LIF action.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts ($T1$$T2$ complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/$T1$$T2$ function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human $T1$ through its central region and with multiple activators--including $T2$, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the $T1$$T2$-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and $T1$$T2$ and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, $T1$$T2$, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein $T1$ and the pocket proteins $T2$, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, $T1$, fibromodulin, and $T2$) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts ($T1$$T2$ containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing $T1$$T2$ suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and $T1$-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and $T2$-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins $T1$, $T2$ and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Activation of protein kinase C decreases phosphorylation of c-Jun at sites that negatively regulate its DNA-binding activity. In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells, c-Jun is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites, three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227-252). Activation of $T1$ results in rapid, site-specific dephosphorylation of $T2$ at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased AP-1-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human c-Jun proteins in vitro by GSK-3 decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold. We propose that c-Jun is present in resting cells in a latent, phosphorylated form that can be activated by site-specific dephosphorylation in response to protein kinase C activation.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins ($T1$, $T2$, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the $T1$ receptor ($T2$) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Characterization of the dystrophin-syntrophin interaction using the two-hybrid system in yeast. The carboxy-terminal region of $T1$ has previously been shown to interact directly with $T2$, a cytoplasmic component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, by in vitro biochemical studies such as overlay assay or immunoprecipitation. Using the two-hybrid system, we have isolated from a human heart cDNA library the entire coding sequence of human alpha1 syntrophin, therefore confirming for the first time this interaction via an in vivo approach. In addition, we have reduced the interaction domain to the distal half of alpha1 syntrophin.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130.

SREBP transcriptional activity is mediated through an interaction with the CREB-binding protein. The sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1 and -2) activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in the cellular uptake and synthesis of cholesterol. Although considerable effort has been exerted to define the events regulating the levels of active SREBP, little is known about the transcriptional cofactors mediating SREBP function. In an unbiased search for potential coactivators of SREBP, we isolated a protein of 265 kD from HeLa cells that directly bound SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. Peptide sequencing and Western blot analysis established that the 265-kD protein was CBP (CREB-binding protein),a recently identified transcriptional coactivator. The putative activation domain of SREBP was shown to bind specifically to amino-terminal domains of recombinant CBP and p300 (a $T1$$T2$ and p300 (a CBP-related protein). Moreover, transfection studies demonstrated that CBP enhances the ability of SREBP to activate transcription of reporter genes in HeLa cells. Together, these data suggest that CBP mediates SREBP transcriptional activity, thus revealing a new step in the biochemical pathway regulating cholesterol metabolism.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with $T1$ and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. $T2$ displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of $T1$$T2$ binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, $T1$, $T2$, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that $T1$, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both $T2$ and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/$T1$$T2$) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human $T1$ (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and $T2$ were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, $T1$$T2$, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the $T1$ protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of $T2$ with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, $T1$, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-$T2$. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human $T1$ through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, $T2$, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

The mitogenic effects of the $T1$ are mediated through cell surface $T2$. We have previously shown that soluble partially degraded fibrin(ogen) remains in solution after fibrin clot formation and is a potent fibroblast mitogen (Gray, A.J., Bishop, J.E., Reeves J.T., Mecham, R.P., and Laurent, G.J. (1995) Am. J. Cell Mol. Biol. 12, 684-690). Mitogenic sites within the fibrin(ogen) molecule are located on the A alpha and B beta chains of the protein (Gray, A.J., Bishop, J. E., Reeves, J.T., and Laurent, G.J. (1993) J. Cell Sci. 104, 409-413). However, receptor pathways through which mitogenic effects are mediated are unknown. The present study sought to determine the nature of fibrin(ogen) receptors expressed on human fibroblasts which interact with the fibrinogen B beta chain. Receptor complexes were isolated from 125I-surface-labeled fibroblasts and purified on a fibrinogen B beta chain affinity column. Subsequent high performance liquid chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated fibrinogen B beta chain bound specifically to a 60-kDa surface protein. Sequence analysis of the amino terminus of this protein indicated 100% homology to human calreticulin. Immunoprecipitation experiments employing a polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody provided further evidence that the 60-kDa protein isolated in this study was calreticulin. Further, polyclonal antibodies to human calreticulin significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of fibrinogen B beta chain on human fibroblasts. The present study has shown that cell surface calreticulin binds to the B beta chain of fibrinogen mediating its mitogenic activity.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the $T1$ subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the $T2$ (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Type II regulatory subunit (RII) of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase interaction with A-kinase anchor proteins requires isoleucines 3 and 5. Compartmentalization of the type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is maintained by association of the regulatory subunit (RII) with A-Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). In previous studies (Scott, J. D., Stofko, R. E., McDonald, J. R., Comer, J. D., Vitalis, E. A., and Mangili J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21561-21566) we have shown that dimerization of RII alpha was required for interaction with the cytoskeletal component microtubule-associated protein 2. In this report we show that the localization and dimerization domains of RII alpha are contained within the first thirty residues of each RII protomer. RII des-5 (an amino-terminal deletion mutant lacking residues 1-5) was unable to bind AKAPs but retained the ability to dimerize. RII alpha I3A,I5A (a mutant where isoleucines 3 and 5 were replaced with alanine) was unable to bind a variety of AKAPs. Mutation of both isoleucines decreased AKAP binding without affecting dimerization, cAMP binding, or the overall secondary structure of the protein. Measurement of $T1$ I3A,I5A interaction with the human $T2$, Ht 31, by two independent methods suggests that mutation of isoleucines 3 and 5 decreases affinity by at least 6-fold. Therefore, we propose that two isoleucine side chains on each RII protomer are principle sites of contact with the conserved amphipathic helix binding domain on AKAPs.

Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae.

The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. $T1$ also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as $T2$. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, $T1$$T2$, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-$T1$, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants $T2$-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and $T1$ and with the dominant inhibitors $T2$ and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Activation of protein kinase C decreases phosphorylation of c-Jun at sites that negatively regulate its DNA-binding activity. In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells, $T1$ is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites, three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by $T2$ (GSK-3). These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227-252). Activation of protein kinase C results in rapid, site-specific dephosphorylation of c-Jun at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased AP-1-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human c-Jun proteins in vitro by GSK-3 decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold. We propose that c-Jun is present in resting cells in a latent, phosphorylated form that can be activated by site-specific dephosphorylation in response to protein kinase C activation.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain ($T1$) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced $T2$ binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating $T1$$T2$ was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of $T1$ and $T2$/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human $T1$ (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human $T2$ (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor ($T1$) and the $T2$ receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Cloning and functional analysis of $T1$: a novel $T2$-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, $T1$, $T2$, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, $T1$, which binds Fas and Fas-$T2$, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased $T1$$T2$ from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the $T1$ ($T2$) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Cloning of TRAP, a ligand for CD40 on human T cells. A cDNA clone, designated TRAP (TNF-related activation protein) was isolated from a collection of T cell activation genes. The polypeptide encoded by a mRNA of approx. 2.3 kb is 261 amino acids long with a calculated M(r) of 29.3 kDa. The structural features predict a type II transmembrane protein, but are also compatible with a secreted form. TRAP is highly similar to an identified murine $T1$$T2$ is highly similar to an identified murine CD40 ligand both at the cDNA (82.8% identity) and the protein (77.4% identity) levels, and related to tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin. Expressed in a murine myeloma, TRAP was identified as a ligand for CD40 by binding to a soluble CD40 construct. TRAP mRNA is expressed in a T cell-specific fashion with a maximum at 8 h after stimulation. The TRAP gene is located in the q26.3-q27.1 region of the X chromosome.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, $T1$, cd44, $T2$, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and $T1$$T2$ and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the $T1$ protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of $T2$ in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing $T1$$T2$ amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to $T1$ and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for $T2$ beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that $T1$ contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the $T2$ binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of $T1$$T2$-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

SREBP transcriptional activity is mediated through an interaction with the CREB-binding protein. The sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1 and -2) activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in the cellular uptake and synthesis of cholesterol. Although considerable effort has been exerted to define the events regulating the levels of active SREBP, little is known about the transcriptional cofactors mediating SREBP function. In an unbiased search for potential coactivators of SREBP, we isolated a protein of 265 kD from HeLa cells that directly bound $T1$ and $T2$. Peptide sequencing and Western blot analysis established that the 265-kD protein was CBP (CREB-binding protein),a recently identified transcriptional coactivator. The putative activation domain of SREBP was shown to bind specifically to amino-terminal domains of recombinant CBP and p300 (a CBP-related protein). Moreover, transfection studies demonstrated that CBP enhances the ability of SREBP to activate transcription of reporter genes in HeLa cells. Together, these data suggest that CBP mediates SREBP transcriptional activity, thus revealing a new step in the biochemical pathway regulating cholesterol metabolism.

The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted.

This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for $T1$$T2$ beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors $T1$ and Bcl-X-S. $T2$ displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak $T1$ binding activity was found in cells transfected with only $T2$; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-$T1$$T2$, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix ($T1$) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, $T2$ and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in $T1$ from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the $T2$ co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by $T1$$T2$-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, $T1$, cd44, fibromodulin, and $T2$) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit ($T1$) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including $T2$, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

Cloning of TRAP, a ligand for CD40 on human T cells. A cDNA clone, designated TRAP (TNF-related activation protein) was isolated from a collection of T cell activation genes. The polypeptide encoded by a mRNA of approx. 2.3 kb is 261 amino acids long with a calculated M(r) of 29.3 kDa. The structural features predict a type II transmembrane protein, but are also compatible with a secreted form. TRAP is highly similar to an identified murine CD40 ligand both at the cDNA (82.8% identity) and the protein (77.4% identity) levels, and related to tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin. Expressed in a murine myeloma, TRAP was identified as a ligand for CD40 by binding to a soluble $T1$$T2$ by binding to a soluble CD40 construct. TRAP mRNA is expressed in a T cell-specific fashion with a maximum at 8 h after stimulation. The TRAP gene is located in the q26.3-q27.1 region of the X chromosome.

Activation of protein kinase C decreases phosphorylation of c-Jun at sites that negatively regulate its DNA-binding activity. In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells, c-Jun is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites, three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227-252). Activation of protein kinase C results in rapid, site-specific dephosphorylation of c-Jun at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased AP-1-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human c-Jun proteins in vitro by GSK-3 decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold. We propose that $T1$ is present in resting cells in a latent, phosphorylated form that can be activated by site-specific dephosphorylation in response to $T2$ activation.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when $T1$$T2$ complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. $T1$ binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of $T2$ and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, $T1$ and pRb2/$T2$. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human $T1$ through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, $T2$, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and $T1$-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-$T2$ and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that $T1$ binds to $T2$ in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate $T1$$T2$ differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, $T1$, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and $T2$) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-$T1$ proteins are able to form complexes with $T2$. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like $T1$$T2$ and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of $T1$ and N+C-SH2 with $T2$ (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of $T1$ with $T2$ results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed $T1$$T2$ (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector $T1$$T2$ complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex).

Type II regulatory subunit (RII) of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase interaction with A-kinase anchor proteins requires isoleucines 3 and 5. Compartmentalization of the type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is maintained by association of the regulatory subunit (RII) with A-Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). In previous studies (Scott, J. D., Stofko, R. E., McDonald, J. R., Comer, J. D., Vitalis, E. A., and Mangili J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21561-21566) we have shown that dimerization of RII alpha was required for interaction with the cytoskeletal component microtubule-associated protein 2. In this report we show that the localization and dimerization domains of RII alpha are contained within the first thirty residues of each RII protomer. RII des-5 (an amino-terminal deletion mutant lacking residues 1-5) was unable to bind AKAPs but retained the ability to dimerize. RII alpha I3A,I5A (a mutant where isoleucines 3 and 5 were replaced with alanine) was unable to bind a variety of AKAPs. Mutation of both isoleucines decreased AKAP binding without affecting dimerization, cAMP binding, or the overall secondary structure of the protein. Measurement of RII alpha I3A,I5A interaction with the human $T1$, $T2$, by two independent methods suggests that mutation of isoleucines 3 and 5 decreases affinity by at least 6-fold. Therefore, we propose that two isoleucine side chains on each RII protomer are principle sites of contact with the conserved amphipathic helix binding domain on AKAPs.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. $T1$ displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as $T2$. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Coassociation of CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) with CD45 on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that $T1$ may be closely associated with the $T2$ protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and $T1$$T2$ beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas $T1$ serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced $T2$ binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, $T1$$T2$ in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing $T1$$T2$ upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor $T1$$T2$ complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, $T1$, fibronectin, cd44, $T2$, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-$T1$$T2$ in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the $T1$$T2$ protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Crystal structure of fibroblast growth factor receptor ectodomain bound to ligand and heparin. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a large family of structurally related proteins with a wide range of physiological and pathological activities. Signal transduction requires association of FGF with its receptor tyrosine kinase (FGFR) and heparan sulphate proteoglycan in a specific complex on the cell surface. Direct involvement of the heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide in the molecular association between FGF and its receptor is essential for biological activity. Although crystal structures of binary complexes of FGF-heparin and FGF-FGFR have been described, the molecular architecture of the FGF signalling complex has not been elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of the $T1$ ectodomain in a dimeric form that is induced by simultaneous binding to $T2$ and a heparin decasaccharide. The complex is assembled around a central heparin molecule linking two FGF1 ligands into a dimer that bridges between two receptor chains. The asymmetric heparin binding involves contacts with both FGF1 molecules but only one receptor chain. The structure of the FGF1-FGFR2-heparin ternary complex provides a structural basis for the essential role of heparan sulphate in FGF signalling.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/$T1$$T2$ activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of $T1$ and $T2$ and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of $T1$ was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila $T2$. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

SREBP transcriptional activity is mediated through an interaction with the CREB-binding protein. The sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1 and -2) activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in the cellular uptake and synthesis of cholesterol. Although considerable effort has been exerted to define the events regulating the levels of active SREBP, little is known about the transcriptional cofactors mediating SREBP function. In an unbiased search for potential coactivators of SREBP, we isolated a protein of 265 kD from HeLa cells that directly bound SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. Peptide sequencing and Western blot analysis established that the 265-kD protein was CBP (CREB-binding protein),a recently identified transcriptional coactivator. The putative activation domain of SREBP was shown to bind specifically to amino-terminal domains of recombinant CBP and p300 (a $T1$$T2$ (a CBP-related protein). Moreover, transfection studies demonstrated that CBP enhances the ability of SREBP to activate transcription of reporter genes in HeLa cells. Together, these data suggest that CBP mediates SREBP transcriptional activity, thus revealing a new step in the biochemical pathway regulating cholesterol metabolism.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and $T1$ and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. $T2$ displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218.

This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of $T1$/$T2$ to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, $T1$$T2$, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.

Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the $T1$ core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of $T2$ in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the $T1$$T2$-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Interactions among members of the Bcl-2 protein family analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/$T1$$T2$ differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.

Characterization of the dystrophin-syntrophin interaction using the two-hybrid system in yeast. The carboxy-terminal region of dystrophin has previously been shown to interact directly with alpha1 syntrophin, a cytoplasmic component of the $T1$$T2$, a cytoplasmic component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, by in vitro biochemical studies such as overlay assay or immunoprecipitation. Using the two-hybrid system, we have isolated from a human heart cDNA library the entire coding sequence of human alpha1 syntrophin, therefore confirming for the first time this interaction via an in vivo approach. In addition, we have reduced the interaction domain to the distal half of alpha1 syntrophin.

Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system. Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with $T1$ and $T2$ was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators. TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including $T1$, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral $T2$, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of $T1$$T2$ activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Activation of $T1$ decreases phosphorylation of $T2$ at sites that negatively regulate its DNA-binding activity. In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells, c-Jun is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites, three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227-252). Activation of protein kinase C results in rapid, site-specific dephosphorylation of c-Jun at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased AP-1-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human c-Jun proteins in vitro by GSK-3 decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold. We propose that c-Jun is present in resting cells in a latent, phosphorylated form that can be activated by site-specific dephosphorylation in response to protein kinase C activation.

Coassociation of CD26 ($T1$) with $T2$ on the surface of human T lymphocytes. In the present report, we demonstrated that modulation of CD26 from T cell surface induced by antiCD26 (1F7) led to enhanced phosphorylation of CD3 zeta tyrosine residues and increased CD4 associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity. We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with CD45, a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating CD45 from T cell lysates. These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of CD26 with CD45 results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

Characterization of the dystrophin-syntrophin interaction using the two-hybrid system in yeast. The carboxy-terminal region of dystrophin has previously been shown to interact directly with alpha1 syntrophin, a cytoplasmic component of the $T1$$T2$ has previously been shown to interact directly with alpha1 syntrophin, a cytoplasmic component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, by in vitro biochemical studies such as overlay assay or immunoprecipitation. Using the two-hybrid system, we have isolated from a human heart cDNA library the entire coding sequence of human alpha1 syntrophin, therefore confirming for the first time this interaction via an in vivo approach. In addition, we have reduced the interaction domain to the distal half of alpha1 syntrophin.

MyoD prevents cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complexes formation in terminally differentiated myocytes. Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD ($T1$$T2$-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation.

FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis. Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like $T1$$T2$ in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal scar.Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar. There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology, and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank. Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages, documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations, for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro. Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins (procollagen I, collagenase, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, $T1$$T2$, elastin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures, whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures. Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made.
