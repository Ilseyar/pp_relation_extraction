Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, $T1$$T2$, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest $T1$ or $T2$. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I ($T1$$T2$) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor ($T1$$T2$ after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands $T1$ or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and $T2$. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds $T1$ at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or $T2$. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the $T1$$T2$ with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling. A cDNA clone encoding a novel, widely expressed protein (called growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 or GRB2) containing one src homology 2 (SH2) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that GRB2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) via its SH2 domain. Interestingly, GRB2 exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem-5. It has been shown that sem-5 and two other genes called let-23 (EGFR like) and let-60 (ras like) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction. To examine whether GRB2 is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells, microinjection studies were performed. While injection of GRB2 or H-ras proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of GRB2 together with $T1$$T2$ together with H-ras protein stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that GRB2/sem-5 plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling.

Activation of $T1$ by $T2$ in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human dystrophin related protein ($T1$ or utrophin) and the $T2$ from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4/Smad4. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in $T1$ and $T2$ at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of $T1$ proteins which are unable to digest $T2$ or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human $T1$ are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus $T2$ 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor ($T1$$T2$ (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by $T1$, $T2$, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human $T1$$T2$. Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family. The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. We have used site-specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the EPOR to search for amino acid residues involved in erythropoietin (EPO) binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble EPO binding proteins (EBP) and characterized for EPO binding activity in a number of different assays. Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 (Phe93) with alanine (F93A mutation) resulted in a drastic reduction in EPO binding in the EBP. More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on EPO binding. Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the EBP. Furthermore, the F93A mutation in full-length EPOR expressed in COS cells abolished detectable EPO binding. This was not a result of processing or transport defects, since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells. Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical EPO binding determinant of the EPOR. Furthermore, since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family, these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands.

Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1).

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, $T1$$T2$, interferon-gamma and IL-2 versus IL-10. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) $T1$$T2$ share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and $T1$$T2$ and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the $T1$ protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for $T2$ and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the $T1$ binding site on $T2$ occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain ($T1$$T2$ receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with $T1$$T2$, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4/Smad4. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, $T1$, and $T2$, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor ($T1$) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of $T2$. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of $T1$ and $T2$ were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated $T1$$T2$ from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

BACKGROUND: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but severe adverse drug disease, characterized by extensive skin and mucosal detachment with participation of different immunoinflammatory pathways, in particular with early participation of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: To further study the potential role of T lymphocytes in the early phase of keratinocyte necrosis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospitals. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with clinical and histopathologic criteria of TEN and 6 patients with second-degree burns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of soluble interleukin (IL) 2 receptor ($T1$$T2$ (sIL-2R) and IL-1alpha in serum samples and fluid of recent blisters. RESULTS: In the blister fluid of patients with TEN, we found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R than in patients with burns, whereas IL-1alpha levels were higher in the blister fluid of burned patients. No significant differences were found in serum samples of patients with TEN and burns, in either sIL-2R or IL-1alpha. In TEN we also found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R in the blister fluid compared with serum samples, pointing to a predominantly local production contrasting with the low concentration of sIL-2R in the blister fluid of burned patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of elevated sIL-2R levels in blister fluid of patients with TEN are probably related to a local down-regulation of an immunologically mediated cytotoxic reaction and further support the involvement of activated T lymphocytes in the early blisters of TEN.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I ($T1$$T2$ and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to $T1$ receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B ($T2$) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The $T1$ protein shares no significant homology with $T2$ or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4/Smad4. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved $T1$, $T2$, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I ($T1$) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 ($T2$). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Human $T1$/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and $T2$, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or $T1$ and the epithelial splice form of $T2$ (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human $T1$ (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of $T2$ in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines $T1$ (IL-1) and $T2$ (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, interferon-gamma and IL-2 versus IL-10. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, $T1$, $T2$ and IL-10 in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of $T1$ and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of $T2$.

Activation of $T1$ kinase by $T2$ in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated $T1$ and its homologues, suggesting that the $T2$ binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Activation of protein kinase C decreases phosphorylation of c-Jun at sites that negatively regulate its DNA-binding activity. In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells, c-Jun is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites, three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227-252). Activation of $T1$ results in rapid, site-specific dephosphorylation of c-Jun at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased $T2$-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human c-Jun proteins in vitro by GSK-3 decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold. We propose that c-Jun is present in resting cells in a latent, phosphorylated form that can be activated by site-specific dephosphorylation in response to protein kinase C activation.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and $T1$ resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the $T2$. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor ($T1$) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and $T2$ and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands $T1$ or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 ($T2$) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of $T1$, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated $T2$ in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of $T1$ proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or $T2$. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor ($T1$) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the $T2$ substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Activation of $T1$$T2$ by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the $T1$ (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist $T2$ (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4/Smad4. The K-ras, p53, $T1$ and $T2$ genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human erythropoietin receptor. Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family. The $T1$ ($T2$) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. We have used site-specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the EPOR to search for amino acid residues involved in erythropoietin (EPO) binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble EPO binding proteins (EBP) and characterized for EPO binding activity in a number of different assays. Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 (Phe93) with alanine (F93A mutation) resulted in a drastic reduction in EPO binding in the EBP. More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on EPO binding. Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the EBP. Furthermore, the F93A mutation in full-length EPOR expressed in COS cells abolished detectable EPO binding. This was not a result of processing or transport defects, since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells. Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical EPO binding determinant of the EPOR. Furthermore, since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family, these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands.

The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling. A cDNA clone encoding a novel, widely expressed protein (called growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 or $T1$$T2$ or GRB2) containing one src homology 2 (SH2) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that GRB2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) via its SH2 domain. Interestingly, GRB2 exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem-5. It has been shown that sem-5 and two other genes called let-23 (EGFR like) and let-60 (ras like) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction. To examine whether GRB2 is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells, microinjection studies were performed. While injection of GRB2 or H-ras proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of GRB2 together with H-ras protein stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that GRB2/sem-5 plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling.

Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor ($T1$) exist: the agonists $T2$ and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

The rates of commitment to renaturation of rhodanese and glutamine synthetase in the presence of the groE chaperonins. Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which rhodanese and glutamine synthetase (GS) are released from groEL in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that $T1$ must interact with $T2$ throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 $T1$$T2$ and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4/Smad4. The K-ras, $T1$, $T2$ and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely $T1$, interferon-gamma and $T2$ versus IL-10. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to $T1$$T2$ in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 ($T1$$T2$ (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands $T1$ or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of $T2$ (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved, function-related epitope topography among helical cytokines. By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of ciliary neurotrophic factor ($T1$) with $T2$ and not with the beta-components, gp130 and LIFR. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, $T1$ induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via $T2$ and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C ($T1$), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or $T2$. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) $T1$$T2$, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both $T1$ and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the $T2$. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human $T1$$T2$ (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-$T1$] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of $T2$ proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to $T1$ (CXCR1) and B ($T2$) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of $T1$, $T2$, p16 and DPC4/Smad4. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the $T1$ after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of $T2$. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 ($T1$) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and $T2$. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C ($T1$$T2$ (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Activation of protein kinase C decreases phosphorylation of c-Jun at sites that negatively regulate its DNA-binding activity. In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells, c-Jun is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites, three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227-252). Activation of protein kinase C results in rapid, site-specific dephosphorylation of $T1$ at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased $T2$-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human c-Jun proteins in vitro by GSK-3 decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold. We propose that c-Jun is present in resting cells in a latent, phosphorylated form that can be activated by site-specific dephosphorylation in response to protein kinase C activation.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of $T1$ and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either $T2$ or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

Soluble interleukin 2 receptor and $T1$$T2$ and interleukin 1alpha in toxic epidermal necrolysis: a comparative analysis of serum and blister fluid samples. BACKGROUND: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but severe adverse drug disease, characterized by extensive skin and mucosal detachment with participation of different immunoinflammatory pathways, in particular with early participation of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: To further study the potential role of T lymphocytes in the early phase of keratinocyte necrosis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospitals. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with clinical and histopathologic criteria of TEN and 6 patients with second-degree burns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of soluble interleukin (IL) 2 receptor (sIL-2R) and IL-1alpha in serum samples and fluid of recent blisters. RESULTS: In the blister fluid of patients with TEN, we found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R than in patients with burns, whereas IL-1alpha levels were higher in the blister fluid of burned patients. No significant differences were found in serum samples of patients with TEN and burns, in either sIL-2R or IL-1alpha. In TEN we also found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R in the blister fluid compared with serum samples, pointing to a predominantly local production contrasting with the low concentration of sIL-2R in the blister fluid of burned patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of elevated sIL-2R levels in blister fluid of patients with TEN are probably related to a local down-regulation of an immunologically mediated cytotoxic reaction and further support the involvement of activated T lymphocytes in the early blisters of TEN.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to $T1$ and the adenovirus $T2$ 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by $T1$$T2$ share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and $T1$ resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the $T2$ receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I $T1$$T2$ complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved, function-related epitope topography among helical cytokines. By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, $T1$$T2$ and not with the beta-components, gp130 and LIFR. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for $T1$ and adenovirus 5 $T2$ 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase ($T1$) and $T2$ [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and $T1$$T2$, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human $T1$ ($T2$) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4/Smad4. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved $T1$, p53, and $T2$, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the $T1$ (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of $T2$. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to $T1$ ($T2$) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the $T1$$T2$ bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Human $T1$/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, $T2$ and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated $T1$ and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on $T2$ occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of $T1$ (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I ($T2$) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed $T1$$T2$, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the $T1$ receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the $T2$-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or $T1$$T2$ (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved, function-related epitope topography among helical cytokines. By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, gp130 and $T1$$T2$ (CNTF) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, gp130 and LIFR. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely $T1$, interferon-gamma and IL-2 versus $T2$. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an $T1$$T2$ (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates $T1$, CXCR2, and the $T2$ by distinct mechanisms.

Soluble interleukin 2 receptor and interleukin 1alpha in toxic epidermal necrolysis: a comparative analysis of serum and blister fluid samples. BACKGROUND: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but severe adverse drug disease, characterized by extensive skin and mucosal detachment with participation of different immunoinflammatory pathways, in particular with early participation of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: To further study the potential role of T lymphocytes in the early phase of keratinocyte necrosis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospitals. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with clinical and histopathologic criteria of TEN and 6 patients with second-degree burns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of soluble interleukin (IL) 2 receptor ($T1$) and $T2$ in serum samples and fluid of recent blisters. RESULTS: In the blister fluid of patients with TEN, we found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R than in patients with burns, whereas IL-1alpha levels were higher in the blister fluid of burned patients. No significant differences were found in serum samples of patients with TEN and burns, in either sIL-2R or IL-1alpha. In TEN we also found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R in the blister fluid compared with serum samples, pointing to a predominantly local production contrasting with the low concentration of sIL-2R in the blister fluid of burned patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of elevated sIL-2R levels in blister fluid of patients with TEN are probably related to a local down-regulation of an immunologically mediated cytotoxic reaction and further support the involvement of activated T lymphocytes in the early blisters of TEN.

Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of $T1$ and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or $T2$ protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in $T1$ reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B ($T2$) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, $T1$ induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and $T2$. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) $T1$$T2$ and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human $T1$$T2$ alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 ($T1$) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or $T2$ and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 $T1$$T2$ 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the $T1$ (IL1R) exist: the agonists $T2$ and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

The rates of commitment to renaturation of rhodanese and glutamine synthetase in the presence of the groE chaperonins. Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which rhodanese and $T1$ (GS) are released from $T2$ in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, p53, $T1$$T2$, p16 and DPC4/Smad4. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, interferon-gamma and IL-2 versus IL-10. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, $T1$ and $T2$ levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the $T1$ amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus $T2$ 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a $T1$$T2$ protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of $T1$$T2$ bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, $T1$, and $T2$. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the $T1$$T2$ and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase ($T1$) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an $T2$, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 ($T1$) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I ($T2$) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Soluble interleukin 2 receptor and interleukin 1alpha in toxic epidermal necrolysis: a comparative analysis of serum and blister fluid samples. BACKGROUND: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but severe adverse drug disease, characterized by extensive skin and mucosal detachment with participation of different immunoinflammatory pathways, in particular with early participation of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: To further study the potential role of T lymphocytes in the early phase of keratinocyte necrosis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospitals. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with clinical and histopathologic criteria of TEN and 6 patients with second-degree burns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of soluble interleukin (IL) 2 receptor (sIL-2R) and IL-1alpha in serum samples and fluid of recent blisters. RESULTS: In the blister fluid of patients with TEN, we found significantly higher levels of $T1$ than in patients with burns, whereas $T2$ levels were higher in the blister fluid of burned patients. No significant differences were found in serum samples of patients with TEN and burns, in either sIL-2R or IL-1alpha. In TEN we also found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R in the blister fluid compared with serum samples, pointing to a predominantly local production contrasting with the low concentration of sIL-2R in the blister fluid of burned patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of elevated sIL-2R levels in blister fluid of patients with TEN are probably related to a local down-regulation of an immunologically mediated cytotoxic reaction and further support the involvement of activated T lymphocytes in the early blisters of TEN.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, $T1$ is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and $T2$, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of $T1$ sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on $T2$ occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of $T1$, p53, p16 and $T2$/Smad4. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of $T1$ (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 ($T2$) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both $T1$$T2$ binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human erythropoietin receptor. Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family. The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. We have used site-specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the EPOR to search for amino acid residues involved in erythropoietin (EPO) binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble $T1$ binding proteins ($T2$) and characterized for EPO binding activity in a number of different assays. Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 (Phe93) with alanine (F93A mutation) resulted in a drastic reduction in EPO binding in the EBP. More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on EPO binding. Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the EBP. Furthermore, the F93A mutation in full-length EPOR expressed in COS cells abolished detectable EPO binding. This was not a result of processing or transport defects, since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells. Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical EPO binding determinant of the EPOR. Furthermore, since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family, these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands.

Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 ($T1$) with the $T2$ in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of $T1$, p53, p16 and DPC4/$T2$. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds $T1$ at a site distinct from those bound by $T2$ or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 ($T1$) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and $T2$. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved, function-related epitope topography among helical cytokines. By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, $T1$ and $T2$. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human $T1$ (DRP or $T2$) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to $T1$ receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the $T2$. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the $T1$ receptor ($T2$) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, $T1$ was found to bind to $T2$, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical study were performed using histological sections obtained during surgery. BMP-2 was detected in mesenchymal cells in the outer fibrous layer and chondrocytes in the inner cartilaginous matrix, positive for Col III and Col II, respectively. BMPRIB mRNA was distributed in chondrocytes. This is the first study to provide observational evidence of the involvement of BMP-2 signaling in the pathogenesis of cartilage cap of osteochondroma. and suggests the role of BMP-2 in the growth of cartilage cap in osteochondroma.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated $T1$$T2$ in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, interferon-gamma and IL-2 versus IL-10. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. $T1$, IL-2 and $T2$ levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human erythropoietin receptor. Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family. The $T1$$T2$ (EPOR) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. We have used site-specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the EPOR to search for amino acid residues involved in erythropoietin (EPO) binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble EPO binding proteins (EBP) and characterized for EPO binding activity in a number of different assays. Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 (Phe93) with alanine (F93A mutation) resulted in a drastic reduction in EPO binding in the EBP. More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on EPO binding. Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the EBP. Furthermore, the F93A mutation in full-length EPOR expressed in COS cells abolished detectable EPO binding. This was not a result of processing or transport defects, since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells. Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical EPO binding determinant of the EPOR. Furthermore, since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family, these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or $T1$ and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by $T2$, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 ($T1$) to be activated by FGF2, $T2$, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling. A cDNA clone encoding a novel, widely expressed protein (called growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 or GRB2) containing one src homology 2 (SH2) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that GRB2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) via its SH2 domain. Interestingly, GRB2 exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem-5. It has been shown that sem-5 and two other genes called let-23 (EGFR like) and let-60 (ras like) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction. To examine whether GRB2 is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells, microinjection studies were performed. While injection of GRB2 or H-ras proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of GRB2 together with H-ras protein stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that $T1$/$T2$ plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling.

Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved, function-related epitope topography among helical cytokines. By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, gp130 and $T1$$T2$ and not with the beta-components, gp130 and LIFR. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human $T1$ ($T2$ or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to $T1$, $T2$, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 ($T1$$T2$ (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of $T1$ is required for its association with the IR and the $T2$. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and $T1$ and the $T2$ antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/$T1$ is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and $T2$, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of $T1$ (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, $T2$, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The $T1$ protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other $T2$ family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

$T1$ binds to an alternatively spliced exon of $T2$. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins.

We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. $T1$ associates with the $T2$ (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-$T1$], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with $T2$ or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling. A cDNA clone encoding a novel, widely expressed protein (called growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 or GRB2) containing one src homology 2 (SH2) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that GRB2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) via its SH2 domain. Interestingly, GRB2 exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem-5. It has been shown that sem-5 and two other genes called let-23 (EGFR like) and let-60 (ras like) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction. To examine whether GRB2 is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells, microinjection studies were performed. While injection of GRB2 or $T1$ proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of $T2$ together with H-ras protein stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that GRB2/sem-5 plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to $T1$, $T2$ and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the $T1$-receptor antagonist $T2$ (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the $T1$ relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or $T2$) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the $T1$$T2$, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only $T1$; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the $T2$. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by $T1$ and $T2$. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human erythropoietin receptor. Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family. The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. We have used site-specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the EPOR to search for amino acid residues involved in erythropoietin (EPO) binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble EPO binding proteins (EBP) and characterized for EPO binding activity in a number of different assays. Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 (Phe93) with alanine (F93A mutation) resulted in a drastic reduction in EPO binding in the EBP. More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on EPO binding. Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the EBP. Furthermore, the F93A mutation in full-length EPOR expressed in COS cells abolished detectable EPO binding. This was not a result of processing or transport defects, since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells. Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical $T1$ binding determinant of the $T2$. Furthermore, since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family, these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, interferon-gamma and IL-2 versus IL-10. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of $T1$, interferon-gamma, IL-2 and $T2$ in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the $T1$ receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and $T2$ and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it ($T1$) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the $T2$ protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands $T1$ or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by $T2$, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of $T1$ and $T2$ provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the $T1$$T2$) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed $T1$ fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated $T2$ kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the $T1$ relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated $T2$. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of $T1$ to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of $T2$. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, $T1$, p16 and DPC4/$T2$. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Soluble $T1$ receptor and $T2$ in toxic epidermal necrolysis: a comparative analysis of serum and blister fluid samples. BACKGROUND: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but severe adverse drug disease, characterized by extensive skin and mucosal detachment with participation of different immunoinflammatory pathways, in particular with early participation of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: To further study the potential role of T lymphocytes in the early phase of keratinocyte necrosis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospitals. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with clinical and histopathologic criteria of TEN and 6 patients with second-degree burns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of soluble interleukin (IL) 2 receptor (sIL-2R) and IL-1alpha in serum samples and fluid of recent blisters. RESULTS: In the blister fluid of patients with TEN, we found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R than in patients with burns, whereas IL-1alpha levels were higher in the blister fluid of burned patients. No significant differences were found in serum samples of patients with TEN and burns, in either sIL-2R or IL-1alpha. In TEN we also found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R in the blister fluid compared with serum samples, pointing to a predominantly local production contrasting with the low concentration of sIL-2R in the blister fluid of burned patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of elevated sIL-2R levels in blister fluid of patients with TEN are probably related to a local down-regulation of an immunologically mediated cytotoxic reaction and further support the involvement of activated T lymphocytes in the early blisters of TEN.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of $T1$$T2$, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both $T1$ and $T2$ resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling. A cDNA clone encoding a novel, widely expressed protein (called growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 or GRB2) containing one src homology 2 (SH2) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that GRB2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) via its SH2 domain. Interestingly, GRB2 exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem-5. It has been shown that sem-5 and two other genes called let-23 (EGFR like) and let-60 (ras like) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction. To examine whether GRB2 is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells, microinjection studies were performed. While injection of $T1$ or $T2$ proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of GRB2 together with H-ras protein stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that GRB2/sem-5 plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands $T1$ or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, $T2$, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the $T1$ amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 $T2$ 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the $T1$$T2$ and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to $T1$ receptor subtypes A ($T2$) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and $T1$ provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or $T2$ protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and $T1$$T2$ and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The $T1$ proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated $T2$ from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-$T1$] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest $T2$ or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and $T1$ and the IL-1-receptor antagonist $T2$ (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by $T1$ or $T2$. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human erythropoietin receptor. Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family. The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. We have used site-specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the EPOR to search for amino acid residues involved in erythropoietin (EPO) binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble EPO binding proteins (EBP) and characterized for EPO binding activity in a number of different assays. Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 (Phe93) with alanine (F93A mutation) resulted in a drastic reduction in $T1$ binding in the $T2$. More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on EPO binding. Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the EBP. Furthermore, the F93A mutation in full-length EPOR expressed in COS cells abolished detectable EPO binding. This was not a result of processing or transport defects, since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells. Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical EPO binding determinant of the EPOR. Furthermore, since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family, these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of $T1$ to $T2$ was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system.

We also mapped the specific domains of the $T1$ and $T2$ participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the $T1$ relatives, human $T2$ related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using $T1$ as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that $T2$ interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, $T1$$T2$ and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor ($T1$$T2$ associates with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the $T1$ relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the $T2$ from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the $T1$ receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the $T2$ antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of $T1$$T2$ (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, $T1$ and IL-2 versus $T2$. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Soluble $T1$$T2$ and interleukin 1alpha in toxic epidermal necrolysis: a comparative analysis of serum and blister fluid samples. BACKGROUND: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but severe adverse drug disease, characterized by extensive skin and mucosal detachment with participation of different immunoinflammatory pathways, in particular with early participation of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: To further study the potential role of T lymphocytes in the early phase of keratinocyte necrosis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospitals. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with clinical and histopathologic criteria of TEN and 6 patients with second-degree burns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of soluble interleukin (IL) 2 receptor (sIL-2R) and IL-1alpha in serum samples and fluid of recent blisters. RESULTS: In the blister fluid of patients with TEN, we found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R than in patients with burns, whereas IL-1alpha levels were higher in the blister fluid of burned patients. No significant differences were found in serum samples of patients with TEN and burns, in either sIL-2R or IL-1alpha. In TEN we also found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R in the blister fluid compared with serum samples, pointing to a predominantly local production contrasting with the low concentration of sIL-2R in the blister fluid of burned patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of elevated sIL-2R levels in blister fluid of patients with TEN are probably related to a local down-regulation of an immunologically mediated cytotoxic reaction and further support the involvement of activated T lymphocytes in the early blisters of TEN.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and $T1$ [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, $T2$. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, $T1$, p16 and $T2$/Smad4. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human $T1$-$T2$ protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions.

We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in $T1$ reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to $T2$ receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling. A cDNA clone encoding a novel, widely expressed protein (called growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 or GRB2) containing one src homology 2 (SH2) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that GRB2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) via its SH2 domain. Interestingly, GRB2 exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem-5. It has been shown that sem-5 and two other genes called let-23 (EGFR like) and let-60 (ras like) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction. To examine whether GRB2 is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells, microinjection studies were performed. While injection of $T1$ or H-ras proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of $T2$ together with H-ras protein stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that GRB2/sem-5 plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the $T1$ substrate-1 ($T2$). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase ($T1$) and phosphatase 2B [$T2$ (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the $T1$ receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the $T2$ IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. $T1$ associates with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of $T2$. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human erythropoietin receptor. Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family. The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. We have used site-specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the $T1$ to search for amino acid residues involved in $T2$ (EPO) binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble EPO binding proteins (EBP) and characterized for EPO binding activity in a number of different assays. Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 (Phe93) with alanine (F93A mutation) resulted in a drastic reduction in EPO binding in the EBP. More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on EPO binding. Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the EBP. Furthermore, the F93A mutation in full-length EPOR expressed in COS cells abolished detectable EPO binding. This was not a result of processing or transport defects, since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells. Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical EPO binding determinant of the EPOR. Furthermore, since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family, these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and $T1$$T2$ and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by $T1$, FGF6, and $T2$. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B ($T1$) and to the $T2$. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. $T1$ and the protein kinase that activates it ($T2$) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with $T1$ or other $T2$ family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, $T1$ and $T2$ versus IL-10. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the $T1$$T2$ binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the $T1$$T2$, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel $T1$$T2$, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. $T1$ and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the $T2$ protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

The mitogenic effects of the B beta chain of fibrinogen are mediated through cell surface calreticulin. We have previously shown that soluble partially degraded fibrin(ogen) remains in solution after fibrin clot formation and is a potent fibroblast mitogen (Gray, A.J., Bishop, J.E., Reeves J.T., Mecham, R.P., and Laurent, G.J. (1995) Am. J. Cell Mol. Biol. 12, 684-690). Mitogenic sites within the fibrin(ogen) molecule are located on the A alpha and B beta chains of the protein (Gray, A.J., Bishop, J. E., Reeves, J.T., and Laurent, G.J. (1993) J. Cell Sci. 104, 409-413). However, receptor pathways through which mitogenic effects are mediated are unknown. The present study sought to determine the nature of fibrin(ogen) receptors expressed on human fibroblasts which interact with the fibrinogen B beta chain. Receptor complexes were isolated from 125I-surface-labeled fibroblasts and purified on a fibrinogen B beta chain affinity column. Subsequent high performance liquid chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated fibrinogen B beta chain bound specifically to a 60-kDa surface protein. Sequence analysis of the amino terminus of this protein indicated 100% homology to human calreticulin. Immunoprecipitation experiments employing a polyclonal anti-$T1$ antibody provided further evidence that the 60-kDa protein isolated in this study was $T2$. Further, polyclonal antibodies to human calreticulin significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of fibrinogen B beta chain on human fibroblasts. The present study has shown that cell surface calreticulin binds to the B beta chain of fibrinogen mediating its mitogenic activity.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized $T1$ to determine the structural requirements of $T2$ to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human erythropoietin receptor. Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family. The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. We have used site-specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the EPOR to search for amino acid residues involved in erythropoietin (EPO) binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble EPO binding proteins ($T1$) and characterized for $T2$ binding activity in a number of different assays. Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 (Phe93) with alanine (F93A mutation) resulted in a drastic reduction in EPO binding in the EBP. More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on EPO binding. Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the EBP. Furthermore, the F93A mutation in full-length EPOR expressed in COS cells abolished detectable EPO binding. This was not a result of processing or transport defects, since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells. Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical EPO binding determinant of the EPOR. Furthermore, since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family, these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands.

Human $T1$/CCL16 is a functional ligand for $T2$, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, p53, $T1$ and $T2$/Smad4. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human $T1$ related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated $T2$. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 ($T1$) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands $T2$ or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved, function-related epitope topography among helical cytokines. By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of $T1$ (CNTF) with $T2$ and not with the beta-components, gp130 and LIFR. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 $T1$$T2$ 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, interferon-gamma and IL-2 versus IL-10. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, interferon-gamma, $T1$ and $T2$ in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The $T1$ proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated $T2$ kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor ($T1$) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of $T2$ in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of $T1$ (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and $T2$. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the $T1$ (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 ($T2$). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the $T1$ mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-$T2$], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the $T1$ protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 $T2$ 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human $T1$ (R) and $T2$ were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and $T1$$T2$, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human $T1$$T2$ alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 ($T1$) and $T2$ (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, interferon-gamma and IL-2 versus IL-10. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of $T1$, interferon-gamma, $T2$ and IL-10 in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [$T1$ (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, $T2$. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to $T1$, CXCR2, and the $T2$. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both $T1$ and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the $T2$ receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus $T1$ 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-$T2$ protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4/Smad4. The $T1$, p53, p16 and $T2$ genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that $T1$ recognizes and activates $T2$, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) $T1$ interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by $T2$. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines $T1$ ($T2$) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of $T1$ and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with $T2$, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of $T1$ (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by $T2$, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and $T1$ provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either $T2$ or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

The rates of commitment to renaturation of rhodanese and glutamine synthetase in the presence of the groE chaperonins. Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which $T1$ and glutamine synthetase (GS) are released from $T2$ in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human erythropoietin receptor. Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family. The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. We have used site-specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the EPOR to search for amino acid residues involved in erythropoietin (EPO) binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble EPO binding proteins (EBP) and characterized for EPO binding activity in a number of different assays. Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 (Phe93) with alanine (F93A mutation) resulted in a drastic reduction in EPO binding in the EBP. More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on EPO binding. Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the EBP. Furthermore, the F93A mutation in full-length $T1$ expressed in COS cells abolished detectable $T2$ binding. This was not a result of processing or transport defects, since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells. Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical EPO binding determinant of the EPOR. Furthermore, since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family, these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands.

Activation of protein kinase C decreases phosphorylation of c-Jun at sites that negatively regulate its DNA-binding activity. In resting human epithelial and fibroblastic cells, c-Jun is phosphorylated on serine and threonine at five sites, three of which are phosphorylated in vitro by $T1$ ($T2$). These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227-252). Activation of protein kinase C results in rapid, site-specific dephosphorylation of c-Jun at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased AP-1-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human c-Jun proteins in vitro by GSK-3 decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold. We propose that c-Jun is present in resting cells in a latent, phosphorylated form that can be activated by site-specific dephosphorylation in response to protein kinase C activation.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) $T1$$T2$ and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human $T1$$T2$ (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or $T1$ and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, $T2$, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor ($T1$) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 ($T2$). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

The mitogenic effects of the B beta chain of fibrinogen are mediated through cell surface calreticulin. We have previously shown that soluble partially degraded fibrin(ogen) remains in solution after fibrin clot formation and is a potent fibroblast mitogen (Gray, A.J., Bishop, J.E., Reeves J.T., Mecham, R.P., and Laurent, G.J. (1995) Am. J. Cell Mol. Biol. 12, 684-690). Mitogenic sites within the fibrin(ogen) molecule are located on the A alpha and B beta chains of the protein (Gray, A.J., Bishop, J. E., Reeves, J.T., and Laurent, G.J. (1993) J. Cell Sci. 104, 409-413). However, receptor pathways through which mitogenic effects are mediated are unknown. The present study sought to determine the nature of fibrin(ogen) receptors expressed on human fibroblasts which interact with the fibrinogen B beta chain. Receptor complexes were isolated from 125I-surface-labeled fibroblasts and purified on a fibrinogen B beta chain affinity column. Subsequent high performance liquid chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated fibrinogen B beta chain bound specifically to a 60-kDa surface protein. Sequence analysis of the amino terminus of this protein indicated 100% homology to human calreticulin. Immunoprecipitation experiments employing a polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody provided further evidence that the 60-kDa protein isolated in this study was calreticulin. Further, polyclonal antibodies to human calreticulin significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of $T1$$T2$ significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of fibrinogen B beta chain on human fibroblasts. The present study has shown that cell surface calreticulin binds to the B beta chain of fibrinogen mediating its mitogenic activity.

Soluble interleukin 2 receptor and interleukin 1alpha in toxic epidermal necrolysis: a comparative analysis of serum and blister fluid samples. BACKGROUND: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but severe adverse drug disease, characterized by extensive skin and mucosal detachment with participation of different immunoinflammatory pathways, in particular with early participation of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: To further study the potential role of T lymphocytes in the early phase of keratinocyte necrosis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospitals. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with clinical and histopathologic criteria of TEN and 6 patients with second-degree burns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of soluble interleukin (IL) 2 receptor (sIL-2R) and $T1$$T2$ (sIL-2R) and IL-1alpha in serum samples and fluid of recent blisters. RESULTS: In the blister fluid of patients with TEN, we found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R than in patients with burns, whereas IL-1alpha levels were higher in the blister fluid of burned patients. No significant differences were found in serum samples of patients with TEN and burns, in either sIL-2R or IL-1alpha. In TEN we also found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R in the blister fluid compared with serum samples, pointing to a predominantly local production contrasting with the low concentration of sIL-2R in the blister fluid of burned patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of elevated sIL-2R levels in blister fluid of patients with TEN are probably related to a local down-regulation of an immunologically mediated cytotoxic reaction and further support the involvement of activated T lymphocytes in the early blisters of TEN.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the $T1$ binding site in hLIF created antagonists of $T2$ action.

The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling. A cDNA clone encoding a novel, widely expressed protein (called growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 or GRB2) containing one src homology 2 (SH2) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that GRB2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) via its SH2 domain. Interestingly, GRB2 exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem-5. It has been shown that sem-5 and two other genes called let-23 (EGFR like) and let-60 (ras like) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction. To examine whether GRB2 is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells, microinjection studies were performed. While injection of GRB2 or H-ras proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of GRB2 together with $T1$$T2$ proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of GRB2 together with H-ras protein stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that GRB2/sem-5 plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and $T1$$T2$, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 ($T1$$T2$ (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the $T1$ (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of $T2$ to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate $T1$$T2$.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin ($T1$$T2$ [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 ($T1$) to be activated by $T2$, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only $T1$; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the $T2$ receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type $T1$, as well as the $T2$ mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human $T1$ related protein ($T2$ or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of $T1$ and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of $T2$. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

$T1$ recruitment by two distinct ligand-induced, tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites in the $T2$ intracellular domain. Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed $T1$ fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated $T2$ in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the $T1$ receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the $T2$ substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the $T1$ (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the $T2$ IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A ($T1$) and B (CXCR2) and to the $T2$. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, $T1$ and $T2$ with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Soluble interleukin 2 receptor and interleukin 1alpha in toxic epidermal necrolysis: a comparative analysis of serum and blister fluid samples. BACKGROUND: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but severe adverse drug disease, characterized by extensive skin and mucosal detachment with participation of different immunoinflammatory pathways, in particular with early participation of activated CD8+ T lymphocytes. OBJECTIVE: To further study the potential role of T lymphocytes in the early phase of keratinocyte necrosis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospitals. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with clinical and histopathologic criteria of TEN and 6 patients with second-degree burns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of soluble interleukin (IL) 2 receptor (sIL-2R) and IL-1alpha in serum samples and fluid of recent blisters. RESULTS: In the blister fluid of patients with TEN, we found significantly higher levels of sIL-2R than in patients with burns, whereas IL-1alpha levels were higher in the blister fluid of burned patients. No significant differences were found in serum samples of patients with TEN and burns, in either sIL-2R or IL-1alpha. In TEN we also found significantly higher levels of $T1$ in the blister fluid compared with serum samples, pointing to a predominantly local production contrasting with the low concentration of $T2$ in the blister fluid of burned patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of elevated sIL-2R levels in blister fluid of patients with TEN are probably related to a local down-regulation of an immunologically mediated cytotoxic reaction and further support the involvement of activated T lymphocytes in the early blisters of TEN.

The rates of commitment to renaturation of rhodanese and glutamine synthetase in the presence of the groE chaperonins. Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which rhodanese and glutamine synthetase ($T1$) are released from $T2$ in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.

Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved, function-related epitope topography among helical cytokines. By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of $T1$ ($T2$) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, gp130 and LIFR. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates $T1$, $T2$, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, interferon-gamma and $T1$ versus $T2$. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor ($T1$) and the $T2$ (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling. A cDNA clone encoding a novel, widely expressed protein (called growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 or GRB2) containing one src homology 2 (SH2) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that GRB2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) via its SH2 domain. Interestingly, GRB2 exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem-5. It has been shown that sem-5 and two other genes called let-23 (EGFR like) and let-60 (ras like) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction. To examine whether GRB2 is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells, microinjection studies were performed. While injection of $T1$ or H-ras proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of GRB2 together with $T2$ protein stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that GRB2/sem-5 plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 ($T1$$T2$ (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with TIMP-1, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of MMP-1.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands $T1$$T2$ (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. $T1$ also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via $T2$. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to $T1$-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of $T2$ and BAG-1.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in $T1$ created antagonists of $T2$ action.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system.

In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the $T1$ antagonist $T2$ (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and $T1$$T2$ binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved, function-related epitope topography among helical cytokines. By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, $T1$$T2$ (CNTF) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, gp130 and LIFR. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor ($T1$) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of $T2$ to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or $T1$ and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 ($T2$) to be activated by FGF2, FGF6, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, $T1$ was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and $T2$ with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.

cDNA cloning and characterization of the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain. We have cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human interleukin 13 receptor alpha chain (IL-13Ralpha). The protein has 76% homology to murine IL-13Ralpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas $T1$ serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common $T2$ (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Syntrophin binds to an alternatively spliced exon of dystrophin. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the cDNA of human beta 1-syntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated beta 1-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human $T1$ (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated $T2$. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on beta 1-syntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the $T1$$T2$ and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an $T1$$T2$ [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by v-Raf in NIH 3T3 cells and in vitro. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of $T1$ in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate $T2$ kinase.

Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of K-ras, p53, p16 and $T1$/$T2$. The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway.

Use of the two hybrid system to detect the association of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, SHPTP2, with another SH2-containing protein, Grb7. SHPTP2 is a ubiquitously-expressed SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase that is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of various receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. SHPTP2 associates with the $T1$ after ligand stimulation, and binding of $T2$ to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2. The yeast two-hybrid system was modified to identify partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Using SHPTP2 as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to the yeast cells, we have found that SHPTP2 interacts with another signaling protein, Grb7. We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of SHPTP2 and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy-terminus of Grb7. We demonstrate that Grb7 binds to SHPTP2 in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either $T1$ or $T2$ protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and $T1$$T2$, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved, function-related epitope topography among helical cytokines. By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, gp130 and LIFR. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the $T1$ and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on $T2$ is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.

A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist. Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor ($T1$) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist $T2$ (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.

Only weak IL-13 binding activity was found in cells transfected with only IL-13Ralpha; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor. Whereas IL-13Ralpha serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) for IL-4 signaling, it could not replace the function of gammac in allowing enhanced IL-2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Ralpha and gammac are similar, and like gammac, IL-13Ralpha is located on chromosome X.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for $T1$ and adenovirus $T2$ 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved, function-related epitope topography among helical cytokines. By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, gp130 and $T1$$T2$) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, gp130 and LIFR. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.

Characterization of the receptor binding sites of human leukemia inhibitory factor and creation of antagonists. Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and gp130 were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of $T1$$T2$ were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of hLIF in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity. The region of hLIF most important for binding to the hLIF-R is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D-helix, carboxyl terminus of the B-helix, and C-D loop. This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four-helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine LIF. The two residues of hLIF that contribute the majority of free energy for hLIF-R binding, Phe-156 and Lys-159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact. This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of human growth hormone for its receptor. A second region of hLIF that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D-helix and A-B loop also had a weak influence on hLIF-R binding. Residues in hLIF from both the A- and C-helices are involved in binding the gp130 co-receptor. Abolition of the gp130 binding site in hLIF created antagonists of LIF action.

Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of interleukin-8 receptor subtypes. We have probed an epitope sequence (His18-Pro19-Lys20-Phe21) in interleukin-8 (IL-8) by site-directed mutagenesis. This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in $T1$ reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the $T2$. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils. This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.

Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the $T1$ ($T2$). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.

Coordination of three signaling enzymes by AKAP79, a mammalian scaffold protein. Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C ($T1$), binds $T2$ at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.

Cloning and functional analysis of BAG-1: a novel Bcl-2-binding protein with anti-cell death activity. Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of $T1$ and $T2$.

Interleukin-10 levels in seminal plasma: implications for chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. PURPOSE: Chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis. We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines within the prostate, namely interleukin (IL)-8, interferon-gamma and IL-2 versus IL-10. We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured levels of IL-8, $T1$, IL-2 and $T2$ in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were correlated with health related quality of life, as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score. RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls. Interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were statistically greater in patients. Furthermore, IL-10 levels correlated directly with measures of life interference (r = 0.52, p <0.01) and pain severity (r = 0.53, p <0 0.01), and inversely with spousal support (r = -0.39, p <0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-10 may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

The catalytic domain of activated collagenase I (MMP-1) is absolutely required for interaction with its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Here, we describe the production of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (rTIMP-1) and wild-type and mutant human collagenase type I (rMMP-1) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system. Wild-type MMP-1, as well as the MMP-1 mutant lacking the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain [des-(248-450)-MMP-1], exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of rTIMP. Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)-MMP-1] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of MMP-1 proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized rTIMP to determine the structural requirements of MMP-1 to form complexes with its inhibitor. Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild-type and C-terminal mutant des-(248-450)-MMP-1 proteins are able to form complexes with TIMP. Neither mutation of His199, nor deletion mutants des-(161-228)-MMP-1 and des-(161-228/248-450)-MMP-1, interact with TIMP. This demonstrates that the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1, in contrast to the corresponding regions of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, does not interact with TIMP-1. In summary, we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with $T1$, which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of $T2$.

Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human $T1$ ($T2$). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.

Loss of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ligand-binding specificity in Apert syndrome. Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (Fgfrs). Apert syndrome (AS) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations. AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues (S252W or P253R) in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 ($T1$) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2, $T2$, and FGF9. These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2.

Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. $T1$ ($T2$)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.
