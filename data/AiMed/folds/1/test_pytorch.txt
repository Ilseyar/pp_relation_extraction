Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. $T1$ and IGIF were diminished in the sera of $T2$-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an $T1$-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to $T2$. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/$T1$ and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric ($T2$/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the $T1$ (pRB) or its relatives p107 and $T2$. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for $T1$$T2$ binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and $T1$ share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, $T2$. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein $T1$/CDK complexes sequester the $T2$-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor $T1$ (also known as the $T2$/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). $T1$ suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in $T2$. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one $T1$$T2$ (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Isolation of human delta-catenin and its binding specificity with presenilin 1. We screened proteins for interaction with presenilin (PS) 1, and cloned the full-length cDNA of human delta-catenin, which encoded 1225 amino acids. Yeast two-hybrid assay, GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that $T1$ interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment of $T2$, but not with that of PS-2. These results suggest that PS1 and PS2 partly differ in function. PS1 loop fragment containing the pathogenic mutation retained the binding ability. We also found another armadillo-protein, p0071, interacted with PS1.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of $T1$, and IL-15 competed for binding with $T2$, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of $T1$$T2$, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for $T1$ and $T2$ in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein $T1$, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and $T2$ (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the $T1$$T2$ protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/$T1$) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, $T2$/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/$T1$$T2$ adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with $T1$$T2$ homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the $T1$ receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with $T2$, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human $T1$$T2$. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in $T1$$T2$ in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both $T1$$T2$ binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain ($T1$$T2$ SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Isolation of human delta-catenin and its binding specificity with presenilin 1. We screened proteins for interaction with presenilin (PS) 1, and cloned the full-length cDNA of human delta-catenin, which encoded 1225 amino acids. Yeast two-hybrid assay, GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that delta-catenin interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment of PS1, but not with that of $T1$$T2$ interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment of PS1, but not with that of PS-2. These results suggest that PS1 and PS2 partly differ in function. PS1 loop fragment containing the pathogenic mutation retained the binding ability. We also found another armadillo-protein, p0071, interacted with PS1.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for $T1$$T2$ with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and $T1$$T2$, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that $T1$ forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor ($T2$ R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric ($T1$/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, $T2$/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the $T1$ ($T2$) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or $T1$$T2$ gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Isolation of human delta-catenin and its binding specificity with presenilin 1. We screened proteins for interaction with presenilin (PS) 1, and cloned the full-length cDNA of human delta-catenin, which encoded 1225 amino acids. Yeast two-hybrid assay, GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that delta-catenin interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment of PS1, but not with that of PS-2. These results suggest that PS1 and PS2 partly differ in function. PS1 loop fragment containing the pathogenic mutation retained the binding ability. We also found another $T1$, p0071, interacted with $T2$.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, $T1$ associates with three different CDKs: $T2$, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of $T1$ is related to the yeast splicing protein $T2$.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for $T1$ but not $T2$; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated $T1$-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the $T2$ precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). $T1$ suppressed $T2$-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for $T1$ and SF3b in the incorporation of $T2$ into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

A region of the beta subunit of the interferon alpha receptor different from box 1 interacts with Jak1 and is sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human $T1$ (IFNalpha) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human $T2$. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNalpha2 binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of $T1$ (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported $T2$ structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to $T1$ from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the $T2$/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. $T1$ was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, $T2$, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric ($T1$/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ $T2$, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and $T1$ associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with $T2$ is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

The retinoblastoma protein associates with the protein phosphatase type 1 catalytic subunit. The retinoblastoma protein (p110RB) interacts with many cellular proteins in complexes potentially important for its growth-suppressing function. We have developed and used an improved version of the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate human cDNAs encoding proteins able to bind p110RB. One clone encodes a novel $T1$ catalytic subunit (PP-1 alpha 2), which differs from the originally defined $T2$ by an amino-terminal 11-amino-acid insert. In vitro-binding assays demonstrated that PP-1 alpha isoforms preferentially bind the hypophosphorylated form of p110RB. Moreover, similar p110RB sequences are required for binding PP-1 alpha 2 and SV40 large T antigen. Cell cycle synchrony experiments revealed that this association occurs from mitosis to early G1. The implications of these findings on the regulation of both proteins are discussed.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or $T1$$T2$ or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and $T1$$T2$ binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal $T1$ binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for $T2$. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and $T1$ competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the $T2$.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/$T1$$T2$ suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between $T1$ and $T2$ or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/$T1$ and $T2$/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

The retinoblastoma protein associates with the protein phosphatase type 1 catalytic subunit. The retinoblastoma protein (p110RB) interacts with many cellular proteins in complexes potentially important for its growth-suppressing function. We have developed and used an improved version of the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate human cDNAs encoding proteins able to bind p110RB. One clone encodes a novel type 1 protein phosphatase catalytic subunit ($T1$), which differs from the originally defined $T2$ by an amino-terminal 11-amino-acid insert. In vitro-binding assays demonstrated that PP-1 alpha isoforms preferentially bind the hypophosphorylated form of p110RB. Moreover, similar p110RB sequences are required for binding PP-1 alpha 2 and SV40 large T antigen. Cell cycle synchrony experiments revealed that this association occurs from mitosis to early G1. The implications of these findings on the regulation of both proteins are discussed.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that p300 and CBP might be involved in YY1-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between YY1 and $T1$, a coactivator for $T2$, is not sufficient for repression of CREB-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of CTF-1-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between YY1 and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress Sp1- and CREB-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not $T1$$T2$ was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Isolation of human delta-catenin and its binding specificity with presenilin 1. We screened proteins for interaction with presenilin (PS) 1, and cloned the full-length cDNA of human delta-catenin, which encoded 1225 amino acids. Yeast two-hybrid assay, GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that delta-catenin interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment of $T1$, but not with that of $T2$. These results suggest that PS1 and PS2 partly differ in function. PS1 loop fragment containing the pathogenic mutation retained the binding ability. We also found another armadillo-protein, p0071, interacted with PS1.

$T1$ suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/$T2$. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma ($T1$) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain ($T2$ R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S $T1$$T2$ interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Isolation of human delta-catenin and its binding specificity with presenilin 1. We screened proteins for interaction with presenilin (PS) 1, and cloned the full-length cDNA of human delta-catenin, which encoded 1225 amino acids. Yeast two-hybrid assay, GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that delta-catenin interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment of PS1, but not with that of PS-2. These results suggest that $T1$ and $T2$ partly differ in function. PS1 loop fragment containing the pathogenic mutation retained the binding ability. We also found another armadillo-protein, p0071, interacted with PS1.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/$T1$$T2$ but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and $T1$$T2$, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, K5, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the $T1$ head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in $T2$ tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by $T1$$T2$ inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric ($T1$/$T2$ and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, $T1$ was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not $T2$. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of $T1$ to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of $T2$ into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not $T1$$T2$ antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and $T1$ competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the $T2$ receptor.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta ($T1$) converting enzyme ($T2$) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/$T1$$T2$ but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted ($T1$), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 ($T2$), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked $T1$$T2$ antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and $T1$, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, $T2$, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The $T1$$T2$ (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain ($T1$$T2$ SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/$T1$, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, $T2$/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the $T1$$T2$-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of $T1$ to generate a structure similar to 17S $T2$, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

A region of the beta subunit of the interferon alpha receptor different from box 1 interacts with Jak1 and is sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human interferon alpha (IFNalpha) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human IFNalpha. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the $T1$-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after $T2$ binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that $T1$/$T2$, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, $T1$/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also $T2$/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of $T1$ is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse $T2$ (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of $T1$$T2$ (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and $T1$ subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and $T2$ from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the $T1$ homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of $T2$). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, $T1$, and $T2$ binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha $T1$ and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and $T2$. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, $T1$ complexes containing $T2$ are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one $T1$$T2$ receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/$T1$$T2$/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. $T1$ is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of $T2$. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ($T1$) or its relatives $T2$ and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both $T1$ and NR2B subunits of the $T2$, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and $T1$$T2$ antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/$T1$$T2$ (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, $T1$ had the remarkable property of binding $T2$ with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the $T1$/$T2$ complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, $T1$ associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, $T2$, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor ($T1$) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating $T2$ and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to $T1$, and $T2$-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of $T1$ to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for $T2$ and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor ($T1$$T2$) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of $T1$/$T2$ to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between $T1$ and $T2$ prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, $T1$ was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not $T2$; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-$T1$ binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, $T2$, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, $T1$/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ $T2$, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by $T1$/$T2$ heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and $T1$$T2$ into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

The retinoblastoma protein associates with the protein phosphatase type 1 catalytic subunit. The $T1$ ($T2$) interacts with many cellular proteins in complexes potentially important for its growth-suppressing function. We have developed and used an improved version of the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate human cDNAs encoding proteins able to bind p110RB. One clone encodes a novel type 1 protein phosphatase catalytic subunit (PP-1 alpha 2), which differs from the originally defined PP-1 alpha by an amino-terminal 11-amino-acid insert. In vitro-binding assays demonstrated that PP-1 alpha isoforms preferentially bind the hypophosphorylated form of p110RB. Moreover, similar p110RB sequences are required for binding PP-1 alpha 2 and SV40 large T antigen. Cell cycle synchrony experiments revealed that this association occurs from mitosis to early G1. The implications of these findings on the regulation of both proteins are discussed.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-$T1$ binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/$T2$. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and $T1$ bind to all $T2$ family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that $T1$ and $T2$ utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of $T1$ ($T2$) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for $T1$$T2$ by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of $T1$$T2$ SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. $T1$, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule $T2$. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, $T1$$T2$, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not $T1$; MCP-3 was an agonist for $T2$ but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and $T1$ associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of $T2$ associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of $T1$ associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including $T2$, K2, K5, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/$T1$ to full-length $T2$ was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

The retinoblastoma protein associates with the protein phosphatase type 1 catalytic subunit. The retinoblastoma protein (p110RB) interacts with many cellular proteins in complexes potentially important for its growth-suppressing function. We have developed and used an improved version of the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate human cDNAs encoding proteins able to bind p110RB. One clone encodes a novel type 1 protein phosphatase catalytic subunit (PP-1 alpha 2), which differs from the originally defined PP-1 alpha by an amino-terminal 11-amino-acid insert. In vitro-binding assays demonstrated that PP-1 alpha isoforms preferentially bind the hypophosphorylated form of p110RB. Moreover, similar $T1$ sequences are required for binding $T2$ and SV40 large T antigen. Cell cycle synchrony experiments revealed that this association occurs from mitosis to early G1. The implications of these findings on the regulation of both proteins are discussed.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with $T1$ in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of $T2$ into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and $T1$/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ $T2$, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor.

The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that $T1$ uses components of the $T2$.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme ($T1$) processes the inactive $T2$ precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma ($T1$$T2$ (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for $T1$$T2$ binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various $T1$/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of $T2$ or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/$T1$) and homomeric ($T2$/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Isolation of human $T1$ and its binding specificity with $T2$. We screened proteins for interaction with presenilin (PS) 1, and cloned the full-length cDNA of human delta-catenin, which encoded 1225 amino acids. Yeast two-hybrid assay, GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that delta-catenin interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment of PS1, but not with that of PS-2. These results suggest that PS1 and PS2 partly differ in function. PS1 loop fragment containing the pathogenic mutation retained the binding ability. We also found another armadillo-protein, p0071, interacted with PS1.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated $T1$$T2$ protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by $T1$$T2$ gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, $T1$$T2$ R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of $T1$$T2$/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of $T1$ associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, $T2$, K5, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse $T1$ does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of $T2$. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-$T1$ binding: MCP-2, $T2$, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/$T1$$T2$ suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of $T1$ and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of $T2$ associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one $T1$$T2$) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for $T1$ but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not $T2$. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. $T1$ was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating $T2$ and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/$T1$ and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ $T2$, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

A region of the beta subunit of the $T1$ receptor different from box 1 interacts with $T2$ and is sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human interferon alpha (IFNalpha) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human IFNalpha. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNalpha2 binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that $T1$ and $T2$ can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Competitive binding of $T1$ and $T2$ to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the $T1$$T2$ observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, $T1$ could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for $T2$. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and $T1$/$T2$) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor $T1$ with $T2$ and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the $T1$ receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the $T2$.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The $T1$ ($T2$) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, $T1$ $T2$ and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to $T1$$T2$ is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, $T1$, or $T2$. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-$T1$ binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, $T2$, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

A region of the beta subunit of the interferon alpha receptor different from box 1 interacts with Jak1 and is sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human interferon alpha ($T1$) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human $T2$. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNalpha2 binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of $T1$ and CDK6 associated with $T2$ does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. $T1$ also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and $T2$. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/$T1$$T2$/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of $T1$$T2$ receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. $T1$ was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor ($T2$) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/$T1$) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ $T2$, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between $T1$ and hTAFII28 or $T2$ were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of $T1$$T2$ dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

A region of the beta subunit of the interferon alpha receptor different from box 1 interacts with $T1$ and is sufficient to activate the $T2$-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human interferon alpha (IFNalpha) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human IFNalpha. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNalpha2 binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 ($T1$$T2$ (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, $T1$-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/$T2$. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that $T1$ and $T2$ share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and $T1$$T2$ R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and $T1$$T2$ receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

$T1$ binds multiple CC-chemokines: $T2$ acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/$T1$$T2$ suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta ($T1$$T2$ (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, $T1$ MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for $T2$ and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the $T1$$T2$ and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Cloning and characterization of $T1$, $T2$ and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with $T1$ does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of $T2$ associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds $T1$ with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to $T2$. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. $T1$ could compete efficiently for $T2$ binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to $T1$$T2$, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various $T1$/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or $T2$ binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor ($T1$$T2$ and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma ($T1$$T2$ (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, $T1$, $T2$, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by $T1$ or $T2$ in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of $T1$ and $T2$ associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

The retinoblastoma protein associates with the protein phosphatase type 1 catalytic subunit. The retinoblastoma protein (p110RB) interacts with many cellular proteins in complexes potentially important for its growth-suppressing function. We have developed and used an improved version of the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate human cDNAs encoding proteins able to bind p110RB. One clone encodes a novel type 1 protein phosphatase catalytic subunit (PP-1 alpha 2), which differs from the originally defined PP-1 alpha by an amino-terminal 11-amino-acid insert. In vitro-binding assays demonstrated that PP-1 alpha isoforms preferentially bind the hypophosphorylated form of p110RB. Moreover, similar $T1$ sequences are required for binding PP-1 alpha 2 and $T2$. Cell cycle synchrony experiments revealed that this association occurs from mitosis to early G1. The implications of these findings on the regulation of both proteins are discussed.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, $T1$ MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and $T2$. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and $T1$ subunits of the $T2$, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The $T1$ (IL-1beta) converting enzyme ($T2$) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of $T1$ associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, K5, and $T2$. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of $T1$, and $T2$ competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also $T1$/ $T2$) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/$T1$ and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, $T2$/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of $T1$ and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with $T2$ is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the $T1$ family to be cloned was designated $T2$, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II).

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of $T1$, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the $T2$ receptor.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta ($T1$$T2$ (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, $T1$$T2$ R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of $T1$ to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and $T2$ in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, $T1$, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: $T2$, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of $T1$$T2$/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that $T1$ and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene ($T2$) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

A region of the beta subunit of the $T1$ different from box 1 interacts with Jak1 and is sufficient to activate the $T2$-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human interferon alpha (IFNalpha) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human IFNalpha. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNalpha2 binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). $T1$ expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds $T2$ with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ $T1$, and also $T2$/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha $T1$ and $T2$ were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-$T1$$T2$ induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the $T1$$T2$ receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S $T1$, which suggests a function for $T2$ and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, $T1$ associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, $T2$, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/$T1$$T2$ heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, $T1$ interacts directly with $T2$; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, $T1$, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, $T2$, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). $T1$ expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to $T2$. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with $T1$ in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and $T2$ in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and $T1$/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also $T2$/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. $T1$ SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the $T2$ dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). $T1$ expressed in an $T2$-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of $T1$ inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating $T2$ and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and $T1$ to the $T2$. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of $T1$ via QM/Jif-1 influences $T2$-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the $T1$$T2$, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, K5, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant $T1$ head and $T2$ tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not $T1$; $T2$ was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the $T1$$T2$-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an $T1$-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds $T2$ with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the $T1$ ($T2$) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/$T1$, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also $T2$/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, $T1$ associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and $T2$. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences $T1$$T2$ influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that $T1$$T2$ forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/$T1$$T2$, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that $T1$ and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, $T2$. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Making a connection: direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of $T1$ associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, $T2$, and K6. We have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding. This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. $T1$ was also shown to cleave the precursor of $T2$ (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S $T1$, which suggests a function for SF3a and $T2$ in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and $T1$, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and $T2$ binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the $T1$-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of $T2$.

A region of the beta subunit of the interferon alpha receptor different from box 1 interacts with Jak1 and is sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human interferon alpha ($T1$$T2$ (IFNalpha) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human IFNalpha. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNalpha2 binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

The $T1$ associates with the $T2$ catalytic subunit. The retinoblastoma protein (p110RB) interacts with many cellular proteins in complexes potentially important for its growth-suppressing function. We have developed and used an improved version of the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate human cDNAs encoding proteins able to bind p110RB. One clone encodes a novel type 1 protein phosphatase catalytic subunit (PP-1 alpha 2), which differs from the originally defined PP-1 alpha by an amino-terminal 11-amino-acid insert. In vitro-binding assays demonstrated that PP-1 alpha isoforms preferentially bind the hypophosphorylated form of p110RB. Moreover, similar p110RB sequences are required for binding PP-1 alpha 2 and SV40 large T antigen. Cell cycle synchrony experiments revealed that this association occurs from mitosis to early G1. The implications of these findings on the regulation of both proteins are discussed.

Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by YY1. The four C-terminal GLI-Kruppel type zinc fingers of YY1 have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain. Previous reports have proposed DNA-bending and activator-quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger-mediated repression. In addition, previous work indicated that p300 and CBP might be involved in YY1-mediated repression. We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger-mediated repression. The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA-binding functions was determined by using a structure-and-function approach. We show that zinc finger 2 of YY1 plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression. However, a survey of a panel of YY1 mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated, which argues against the DNA-bending model for repression. We show that the physical interaction between $T1$ and $T2$, a coactivator for CREB, is not sufficient for repression of CREB-mediated transcription. Our studies indicate that YY1 functions as an activator-specific repressor. Repression of CTF-1-directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between YY1 and this activator. In contrast, physical interaction is not necessary for YY1 to repress Sp1- and CREB-mediated transcription. Rather, the repression likely reflects an ability of YY1 to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery. Taken together, our results suggest that YY1 employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator-specific repression.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 ($T1$$T2$ (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R ($T1$$T2$ (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal $T1$$T2$ binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric ($T1$/BR-II, $T2$/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/$T1$, a negative regulator of $T2$, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with $T1$ in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S $T2$, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Isolation of human delta-catenin and its binding specificity with presenilin 1. We screened proteins for interaction with presenilin (PS) 1, and cloned the full-length cDNA of human delta-catenin, which encoded 1225 amino acids. Yeast two-hybrid assay, GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that delta-catenin interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment of PS1, but not with that of PS-2. These results suggest that PS1 and PS2 partly differ in function. PS1 loop fragment containing the pathogenic mutation retained the binding ability. We also found another armadillo-protein, $T1$, interacted with $T2$.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with $T1$ does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with $T2$ is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ $T1$, BR-Ib/ $T2$, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and $T1$ were both potent agonists for $T2$ and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: $T1$, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and $T2$ binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID. We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of $T1$ and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of $T2$. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected. These results reveal differences not only in subunit composition, but also in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID complexes.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with $T1$ in the presence of $T2$ to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, $T1$$T2$ utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/$T1$$T2$ R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and $T1$/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, $T2$/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. $T1$ and $T2$ were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to $T1$, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of $T2$. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

A region of the beta subunit of the $T1$ receptor different from box 1 interacts with Jak1 and is sufficient to activate the $T2$-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human interferon alpha (IFNalpha) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human IFNalpha. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNalpha2 binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or $T1$$T2$ antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the $T1$, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and $T2$ from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of $T1$ (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating $T2$ and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma ($T1$) that binds one $T2$ (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/$T1$ and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also $T2$/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the $T1$ receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that $T2$ uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various $T1$/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or $T2$ in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

A region of the beta subunit of the interferon alpha receptor different from box 1 interacts with Jak1 and is sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human interferon alpha (IFNalpha) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human IFNalpha. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNalpha2 binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for $T1$ binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with $T2$ kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for $T1$$T2$ interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Involvement of $T1$ signal transducer gp130 in $T2$-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human $T1$ (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds $T2$ specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

$T1$ suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with $T2$/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, $T1$ was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; $T2$ was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ $T1$, $T2$/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and $T1$, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: $T2$, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Activation of $T1$ mediated by $T2$. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of $T1$ associated with $T2$ is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, $T1$, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, $T2$, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. $T1$ binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the $T2$, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: $T1$, CDK4, and $T2$. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ $T1$, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also $T2$/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein $T1$, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 ($T2$), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by $T1$$T2$ antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Isolation of human delta-catenin and its binding specificity with presenilin 1. We screened proteins for interaction with presenilin (PS) 1, and cloned the full-length cDNA of human delta-catenin, which encoded 1225 amino acids. Yeast two-hybrid assay, GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that delta-catenin interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment of PS1, but not with that of PS-2. These results suggest that PS1 and PS2 partly differ in function. PS1 loop fragment containing the pathogenic mutation retained the binding ability. We also found another $T1$, $T2$, interacted with PS1.

$T1$ suppresses the function of $T2$ homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of $T1$$T2$ (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Expression cloning and characterization of a human IL-10 receptor. cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse $T1$ ($T2$). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

A region of the beta subunit of the $T1$$T2$ different from box 1 interacts with Jak1 and is sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human interferon alpha (IFNalpha) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human IFNalpha. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNalpha2 binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by $T1$$T2$/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and $T1$, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, $T2$, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric ($T1$/BR-Ia and $T2$/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of $T1$$T2$ antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one $T1$$T2$ R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and $T1$ associated with $T2$ does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, SF3b, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. $T1$ interacts with $T2$ in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Activation of $T1$ inducing factor mediated by $T2$ converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/$T1$$T2$/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that $T1$ forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor ($T2$) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

The retinoblastoma protein associates with the protein phosphatase type 1 catalytic subunit. The retinoblastoma protein (p110RB) interacts with many cellular proteins in complexes potentially important for its growth-suppressing function. We have developed and used an improved version of the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate human cDNAs encoding proteins able to bind p110RB. One clone encodes a novel type 1 protein phosphatase catalytic subunit (PP-1 alpha 2), which differs from the originally defined PP-1 alpha by an amino-terminal 11-amino-acid insert. In vitro-binding assays demonstrated that PP-1 alpha isoforms preferentially bind the hypophosphorylated form of p110RB. Moreover, similar p110RB sequences are required for binding $T1$ and $T2$. Cell cycle synchrony experiments revealed that this association occurs from mitosis to early G1. The implications of these findings on the regulation of both proteins are discussed.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and $T1$ competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that $T2$ uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

A region of the beta subunit of the interferon alpha receptor different from box 1 interacts with Jak1 and is sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state. Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human $T1$$T2$ (IFNalpha) receptor is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human IFNalpha. To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in IFNalpha signaling, we coexpressed wild-type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L-929 cells. Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids (AAs) (AAs 265-346) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the Jak-Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after IFNalpha2 binding to the receptor. This region of the betaL chain, required for Jak1 binding and activation, contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with Jak kinases. However, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain, we demonstrate that the main Jak1-binding region (corresponding to AAs 300-346 on the beta subunit) is distinct from the Box 1 domain (AAs 287-295).

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of $T1$-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule $T2$. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members ($T1$ and $T2$). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/$T1$ and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/$T2$, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of c-Jun, is a candidate to mediate the function of PS1 in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of $T1$/Jif-1 to full-length $T2$ was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the $T1$$T2$.

Formation of p27-CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of $T1$ is significantly lower than the amount of $T2$ in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-$T1$ binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and $T2$ binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor. Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and $T1$$T2$), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, (MIP)-1 alpha MIP and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both $T1$ and $T2$ bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor. The mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors are immobilized at postsynaptic sites in neurons are largely unknown. The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both $T1$ and $T2$ subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain. Intriguingly, NR1-alpha-actinin binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus alpha-actinin may play a role in both the localization of NMDA receptors and their modulation by Ca2+.

BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that IFN-gamma SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor (IFN-gamma R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and $T1$$T2$ R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and $T1$ prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with $T2$. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by $T1$$T2$ mediated by interleukin-1beta converting enzyme. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.

The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.

Interaction of mammalian splicing factor SF3a with U2 snRNP and relation of its 60-kD subunit to yeast PRP9. In the assembly of a prespliceosome, $T1$ (snRNP) functions in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing together with splicing factors (SFs) 3a, $T2$, and several other proteins. The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides. SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of SF3b to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for SF3a and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome. Furthermore, the 60-kilodalton subunit of SF3a is related to the yeast splicing protein PRP9.

Involvement of IL-6 signal transducer gp130 in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that $T1$ and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, $T2$, in TF-1 cells.

CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to $T1$, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, $T2$, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.

Presenilin 1 suppresses the function of c-Jun homodimers via interaction with QM/Jif-1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mapped to chromosome 14. Here we show that QM/Jun-interacting factor (Jif)-1, a negative regulator of $T1$, is a candidate to mediate the function of $T2$ in the cell. We screened for proteins that bind to PS1 from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/Jif-1 gene. The binding of QM/Jif-1 to full-length PS1 was confirmed in vitro by pull-down assay, and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assays with human samples, including AD brains. Immunoelectronmicroscopic analysis showed that QM/Jif-1 and PS1 are colocalized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear matrix in human brain neurons. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1. By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of QM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of c-Jun homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE). PS1 suppressed c-jun-associated apoptosis by retinoic acid in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas this suppression of apoptosis is attenuated by mutation in PS1. Collectively, the novel function of PS1 via QM/Jif-1 influences c-jun-mediated transcription and apoptosis.

In vivo association of E2F and DP family proteins. The mammalian transcription factor E2F plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle. This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the $T1$ (pRB) or its relatives $T2$ and p103. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.

Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells: a new oligomerization mode for serine/threonine kinase receptors. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth. The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors, whose activation has been investigated intensively for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor subfamily. However, the interactions between the BMP receptors, the composition of the active receptor complex, and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the TGF-beta receptors. Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand. Using several complementary approaches, we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors (BR-Ia and BR-Ib) and the BMP type II receptor (BR-II). Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand. These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after BMP-2 binding and cross-linking. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/$T1$) and homomeric (BR-II/$T2$, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand. BMP-2 binding significantly increased hetero- and homo-oligomerization (except for the BR-II homo-oligomer, which binds ligand poorly in the absence of BR-I). In contrast to previous observations on TGF-beta receptors, which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand, the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern. This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the TGF-beta receptors.

Design, characterization, and structure of a biologically active single-chain mutant of human IFN-gamma. A mutant form of human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma SC1) that binds one IFN-gamma receptor alpha chain (IFN-gamma R alpha) has been designed and characterized. IFN-gamma SC1 was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the IFN-gamma dimer by a seven-residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that $T1$ SC1 forms a 1:1 complex with its high-affinity receptor ($T2$ R alpha) with an affinity of 27(+/- 9) nM. The crystal structure of IFN-gamma SC1 has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6. Comparison of the wild-type receptor-binding domain and the Asp111-containing domain of IFN-gamma SC1 show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials. As a result, surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111-->Asp domain of to bind IFN-gamma R alpha. The AB loops of IFN-gamma SC1 adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of IFN-gamma observed in the crystal structure of the IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma R alpha complex. Thus, IFN-gamma R alpha binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested. The structure also reveals the final six C-terminal amino acid residues of IFN-gamma SC1 (residues 253-258) that have not been observed in any other reported IFN-gamma structures. Despite binding to only one IFN-gamma R alpha, IFN-gamma SC1 is biologically active in cell proliferation, MHC class I induction, and anti-viral assays. This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit IFN-gamma R alpha and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity. The current data are consistent with the main role of the IFN-gamma dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of IFN-gamma for its cellular receptors.

Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the interleukin-2 receptor. A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the $T1$$T2$, indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.

Activation of interferon-gamma inducing factor mediated by $T1$$T2$. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1beta precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-gamma and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE-/- mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE-/- mice may account for their protection from septic shock.
