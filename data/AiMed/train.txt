An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (entity1_term-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the entity2_term/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex).

Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing entity1_term-entity2_term (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle.

These findings strongly suggest that CD26 may be closely associated with the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of entity1_term with entity2_term results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity, zeta chain phosphorylation, and T cell activation.

Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing entity1_term-entity2_term bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others.

Further studies on the interaction of entity1_term with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that HLA-E associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and calreticulin, and that entity2_term expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent.
