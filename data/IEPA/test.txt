In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and entity1_term genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain entity2_term genes and the leptin gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and insulin in response to oxytocin treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of oxytocin influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both insulin and CCK levels were decreased in response to the oxytocin treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that entity1_term induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and entity2_term, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial entity1_term was increased within 30 seconds after entity2_term treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that OT stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding IP3 and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed Summing up, new evidence suggests that entity1_term and entity2_term may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level

Effect of residual endogenous insulin secretion on the abnormal oxytocin response to hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetics Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous insulin secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates OT secretion DESIGN: Case-control study: the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous insulin secretion Blood samples for OT assay were taken just before the rapid injection of insulin (time 0) and at time 15, 30, 45 and 60 min CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a residual endogenous entity1_term secretion exerts a partial protective action against the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder affecting the entity2_term secretory system in IDDM

In the fasting state UCP-2 expression correlated inversely with body mass index (r = -0.45; P = 0.026), percent body fat (r = -0.41; P = 0.05), plasma insulin (r = -0.47; P = 0.02), epigastric venous fatty acids (r = -0.45; P = 0.04), and leptin (r = -0.50; P = 0.018) entity1_term expression remained inversely related with plasma entity2_term after controlling for percent body (r = -0.45; P = 0.038) In conclusion, 1) UCP-2 messenger ribonucleic acid expression in sc adipose tissue is inversely related to adiposity and independently linked to local plasma leptin levels; and 2) UCP-2 expression is not acutely regulated by food intake, insulin, or fatty acids

The activity of the MAPKs, induced by AVP or PMA was inhibited by downregulation of protein kinase C (PKC), by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059 We suggest that entity1_term activates the 42/44kDa MAPKs through a signal transduction pathway that involves stimulation of AVP-V1 receptor, tyrosine kinase, entity2_term and MEK
