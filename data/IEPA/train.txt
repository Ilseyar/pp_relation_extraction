The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng oxytocin caused a significant rise not only of insulin but also of glucagon and glucose levels In contrast, nanogram amounts of entity1_term administered ICV cause a rise of entity2_term levels

Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and entity1_term, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), entity2_term (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, UCP-2, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins

We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, entity1_term also causes the translocation of entity2_term from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

In normal pancreatic islets, entity1_term is upregulated by entity2_term and is low in leptin-resistant islets of ZDF rats To determine whether UCP-2 does, in fact, have uncoupling activity and, if so, whether such activity would favorably influence the abnormalities in leptin-unresponsive UCP-2-underexpressing islets of diabetic ZDF rats, we transferred the UCP-2 gene to the islets of diabetic ZDF rats and lean (+/+) ZDF control rats We conclude that UCP-2 has uncoupling function when overexpressed in leptin-insensitive islets and that its overexpression corrects the underexpression of the insulin gene and ameliorates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, possibly by increasing the ATP:ADP ratio

Roles of GTP and phospholipase C in the potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion by glucose in rat pancreatic islets There was a 98% greater augmentation of insulin secretion by 16.7 mM glucose (in the presence of diazoxide and 40 mM K+) in primed islets; however, the ability of high glucose to augment entity1_term activity bore no relationship to the secretory response MPA markedly inhibited PLC in both conditions; however, entity2_term secretion was only inhibited (by 46%) in primed islets These data indicate that an adequate level of GTP is critical for glucose's potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion in primed islets but that PLC activation can clearly be dissociated from insulin secretion and therefore cannot be the major cause of glucose's augmentation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion

Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma entity1_term, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle entity2_term subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT UCP-3 mRNA to 30-40% of control However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and UCPs appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics

Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and phospholipase C (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in PLC-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on entity1_term-mediated entity2_term secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Immunohistochemical localization of leptin and uncoupling protein in white and brown adipose tissue To establish the cell type expressing leptin, we also assessed the size and organization of lipid droplets, the ultrastructural features of mitochondria, and the presence or absence of uncoupling protein, a brown fat-specific marker In brown adipose tissue of lean animals, multilocular uncoupling protein (UCP)-positive brown adipocytes had typical brown mitochondria and were entity1_term-negative, both in fed and fasted conditions At the periphery of the interscapular brown adipose tissue depot, unilocular, entity2_term-negative adipocytes (mean diameter: 41.55 microns) with white-type mitochondria were observed, and these cells were leptin-positive In obese (db/db) animals, brown fat was composed mainly of small unilocular, UCP-positive adipocytes (mean diameter: 40.08 microns), which were also leptin-positive In summary, classical brown adipocytes differ from white adipocytes, not only by their morphology and UCP expression, but also by their apparent lack of detectable leptin expression

In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and uncoupling protein genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for entity1_term (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the entity2_term gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways
