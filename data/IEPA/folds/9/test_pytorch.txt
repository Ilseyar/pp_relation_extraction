In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and uncoupling protein genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for $T1$$T2$ genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the leptin gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways

Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed Summing up, new evidence suggests that $T1$ and $T2$ may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level

Leptin effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and neuropeptide Y [In Process Citation] Leptin may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and $T1$$T2$, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

We previously reported that adiposity and serum leptin levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum leptin are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic NPY mRNA by leptin may be impaired with age We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus $T1$ infusion diminished hypothalamic $T2$ levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in senescent rats These diminished responses to leptin were associated with and may be the result of an impaired suppression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels

Induction by leptin of uncoupling protein-2 and enzymes of fatty acid oxidation Here we show that leptin alters in pancreatic islets the mRNA of the genes encoding enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) $T1$ overexpression increased $T2$ mRNA by more than 10-fold in epididymal, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous fat tissue of normal, but not of leptin-receptor-defective obese rats By directly regulating the expression of enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and of UCP-2, leptin controls intracellular triglyceride content of certain nonadipocytes, as well as adipocytes

In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and uncoupling protein genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain $T1$$T2$ genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the leptin gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways

Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and $T1$$T2$ in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed Summing up, new evidence suggests that NPY and leptin may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level

8-OH-DPAT also increased $T1$ and decreased CCK and somatostatin levels, effects that were blocked by pretreatment with the $T2$ antagonist Taken together, these data suggest that the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on plasma levels of insulin, somatostatin and CCK may be mediated by oxytocin In previous experiments, we have shown that following i.c.v. application of oxytocin, plasma levels of insulin are increased through a cholinergic mechanism

We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial IP3 was increased within 30 seconds after OT treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that $T1$ stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding $T2$ and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

OT may rapidly stimulate inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) formation, consistent with the concept of rapid activation of a second-messenger system In support of this hypothesis, endometrial $T1$ levels were increased (P < 0.05) within 0.5 min after treatment with 0.1 microM $T2$ These results indicate that OT induces endometrial IP3 production in a rapid manner indicative of a second-messenger system

Wortmannin converts insulin but not oxytocin from an antilipolytic to a lipolytic agent in the presence of forskolin The present studies compared the effects of insulin in rat adipocytes with the effects of oxytocin and peroxovanadate, which mimic some effects of insulin The antilipolytic effects of peroxovanadate and $T1$ were unaffected by 500 nmol/L wortmannin, which blocked the antilipolytic action of $T2$ The data provide additional support for the hypothesis that oxytocin and peroxovanadate affect adipose tissue metabolism by mechanisms distinctly different from those involved in insulin action
