Chronic central leptin infusion enhances insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism and favors the expression of uncoupling proteins In marked contrast, intracerebroventricular leptin administration was accompanied by the maintenance of high UCP1, UCP2, and $T1$$T2$, and UCP3 expression in all these tissues While leptin maintains or favors energy-dissipating mechanisms (UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3), the latter are markedly depressed in pair-fed rats

We previously reported that adiposity and serum leptin levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum leptin are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic NPY mRNA by leptin may be impaired with age We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus $T1$ infusion diminished hypothalamic $T2$ levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in senescent rats These diminished responses to leptin were associated with and may be the result of an impaired suppression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels

$T1$, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, $T2$ (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the $T1$ to modulate the activity of $T2$, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

Insulin-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with $T1$$T2$ has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that insulin treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PLCgamma, are expressed at sufficient levels.

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on $T1$ expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in $T2$ To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of $T1$ encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic $T2$ that is particularly abundant in the brain

The aim of the present study was to investigate how $T1$ given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of $T2$, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng oxytocin caused a significant rise not only of insulin but also of glucagon and glucose levels In contrast, nanogram amounts of oxytocin administered ICV cause a rise of insulin levels

We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial $T1$ was increased within 30 seconds after $T2$ treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that OT stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding IP3 and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of $T1$ on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of $T2$ Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Interleukin-1 beta inhibits phospholipase C and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and $T1$$T2$ and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and insulin secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both PLC as well as Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis

Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed Summing up, new evidence suggests that $T1$ and $T2$ may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level

Leptin effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and neuropeptide Y [In Process Citation] $T1$ may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of $T2$ (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic $T1$ secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of $T2$ distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA).

C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of $T1$-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA $T2$ transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Induction by leptin of uncoupling protein-2 and enzymes of fatty acid oxidation Here we show that leptin alters in pancreatic islets the mRNA of the genes encoding enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) Leptin overexpression increased $T1$$T2$ (UCP-2) Leptin overexpression increased UCP-2 mRNA by more than 10-fold in epididymal, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous fat tissue of normal, but not of leptin-receptor-defective obese rats By directly regulating the expression of enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and of UCP-2, leptin controls intracellular triglyceride content of certain nonadipocytes, as well as adipocytes

Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and $T1$ (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT UCP-3 mRNA to 30-40% of control However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and $T2$ appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics

Overexpression of G11alpha and isoforms of phospholipase C in islet  beta-cells reveals a lack of correlation between inositol phosphate  accumulation and insulin secretion. It has been suggested that insulin secretion from pancreatic islets may be  mediated in part by activation of phospholipases C (PLCs) and  phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The purpose of this study was to determine  whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated $T1$ secretion responses  of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or  activation of $T2$ isoforms. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PLC-delta1, -beta1, or  -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement  in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in insulin  secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite  the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell  extracts. Overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets  elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on  insulin secretion. Because the effect of carbachol on insulin secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PLC-beta1  or -beta3. Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect  slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3, but  these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated insulin  secretion.

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for $T1$ at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of PKC-alpha, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not $T2$, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that PKC activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

Activation of EGFR overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes leads to a 3.4 +/- 1.2-fold stimulation of PLC activity over basal levels vs. only 1.06 +/- 0.01-fold stimulation by insulin. Despite the low levels of $T1$-induced $T2$ activity, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was similarly inhibited by U73122 (55.9 +/- 13.1% inhibition) Inhibition of PLC activation did not impair either EGF- or insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase or incorporation of glucose into lipid, supporting the hypothesis that both EGF- and insulin-induced glucose disposal can be independent of GLUT4-mediated glucose transport. The diminution of glucose transport secondary to inhibition of PLC activity was reflected by a decrease in GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane upon either EGF or insulin stimulation

We have recently shown that $T1$ causes a $T2$ (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, AVP also causes the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the $T1$ (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of $T2$ in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

In normal pancreatic islets, $T1$ is upregulated by $T2$ and is low in leptin-resistant islets of ZDF rats To determine whether UCP-2 does, in fact, have uncoupling activity and, if so, whether such activity would favorably influence the abnormalities in leptin-unresponsive UCP-2-underexpressing islets of diabetic ZDF rats, we transferred the UCP-2 gene to the islets of diabetic ZDF rats and lean (+/+) ZDF control rats We conclude that UCP-2 has uncoupling function when overexpressed in leptin-insensitive islets and that its overexpression corrects the underexpression of the insulin gene and ameliorates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, possibly by increasing the ATP:ADP ratio

Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma $T1$, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle $T2$ subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT UCP-3 mRNA to 30-40% of control However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and UCPs appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics

We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial IP3 was increased within 30 seconds after OT treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that $T1$ stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding $T2$ and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with $T1$ causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and $T2$ that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation. However, both EGF and insulin stimulated the accumulation of phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the insulin-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and insulin in response to oxytocin treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of oxytocin influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both insulin and CCK levels were decreased in response to the oxytocin treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that $T1$ induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and $T2$, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

Gamma-aminobutyric acid mediation of the inhibitory effect of nitric oxide on the arginine vasopressin and $T1$ responses to $T2$-induced hypoglycemia Previous studies have demonstrated that the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME exerts positive effects on the arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, suggesting inhibitory actions of NO AVP and OT secretory patterns during insulin (0.15 IU/kg, i.v.)-tolerance tests (ITT) were examined in seven normal male subjects with (experimental tests) and without (control test) concomitant treatment with L-NAME (40 micrograms/kg injected plus 50 micrograms/kg infused, i.v.), the GABAergic agent sodium valproate (600 mg in three divided doses orally) or the combination of L-NAME and sodium valproate Insulin-induced hypoglycemia increased by 2-fold (peak vs. baseline) plasma AVP and OT levels These data indicate a GABAergic mediation of the inhibitory modulation by NO of the AVP and OT responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of $T1$$T2$ (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

Roles of GTP and phospholipase C in the potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion by glucose in rat pancreatic islets There was a 98% greater augmentation of insulin secretion by 16.7 mM glucose (in the presence of diazoxide and 40 mM K+) in primed islets; however, the ability of high glucose to augment PLC activity bore no relationship to the secretory response MPA markedly inhibited PLC in both conditions; however, $T1$$T2$ activity bore no relationship to the secretory response MPA markedly inhibited PLC in both conditions; however, insulin secretion was only inhibited (by 46%) in primed islets These data indicate that an adequate level of GTP is critical for glucose's potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion in primed islets but that PLC activation can clearly be dissociated from insulin secretion and therefore cannot be the major cause of glucose's augmentation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion

Overexpression of G11alpha and isoforms of $T1$ in islet  beta-cells reveals a lack of correlation between inositol phosphate  accumulation and $T2$ secretion. It has been suggested that insulin secretion from pancreatic islets may be  mediated in part by activation of phospholipases C (PLCs) and  phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The purpose of this study was to determine  whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated insulin secretion responses  of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or  activation of PLC isoforms. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PLC-delta1, -beta1, or  -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement  in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in insulin  secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite  the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell  extracts. Overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets  elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on  insulin secretion. Because the effect of carbachol on insulin secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PLC-beta1  or -beta3. Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect  slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3, but  these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated insulin  secretion.

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of $T1$ in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by $T2$ (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of PKC-alpha, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not $T1$, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that $T2$ activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of $T1$ is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of $T2$ secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Furthermore, treatment of isolated rat diaphragms and adipocytes with PIG-P as well as with other agents exerting partially insulin-mimetic activity, such as PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and the sulfonylurea glimepiride, triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of the caveolar marker protein caveolin, which was apparently correlated with stimulation of lipogenesis Strikingly, in adipocytes subjected to combined trypsin/salt treatment, PIG-P, PI-specific PLC, and glimepiride failed completely to provoke $T1$$T2$, and glimepiride failed completely to provoke insulin-mimetic effects

The expression of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 were up-regulated by 3.2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, during the late stage of pregnancy with an increase of WAT leptin mRNA expression and exogenous administration of leptin resulted in induction of the uterine UCP2 and $T1$$T2$ and UCP3 levels These results indicate that UCP gene expressions during pregnancy are regulated tissue-dependently, and up-regulation of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA may be due to increased leptin levels

$T1$-like signaling in yeast: modulation of protein phosphatase 2A, protein kinase A, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activities In addition, $T2$ (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by insulin, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus insulin in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the GPI-PLC GPI-PLC was most pronouncedly stimulated by authentic human insulin compared to various insulin analogues and insulin-like growth factor I As the GPI-PLC reaction is rate limiting, the efficiency of the two-step anchor cleavage was significantly increased when insulin was present together with glucose as compared to glucose alone The insulin concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation The data suggest that mammalian insulin-sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC) involved in the transduction of the insulin signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase

Immunohistochemical localization of leptin and uncoupling protein in white and brown adipose tissue To establish the cell type expressing leptin, we also assessed the size and organization of lipid droplets, the ultrastructural features of mitochondria, and the presence or absence of uncoupling protein, a brown fat-specific marker In brown adipose tissue of lean animals, multilocular uncoupling protein (UCP)-positive brown adipocytes had typical brown mitochondria and were $T1$$T2$, a brown fat-specific marker In brown adipose tissue of lean animals, multilocular uncoupling protein (UCP)-positive brown adipocytes had typical brown mitochondria and were leptin-negative, both in fed and fasted conditions At the periphery of the interscapular brown adipose tissue depot, unilocular, UCP-negative adipocytes (mean diameter: 41.55 microns) with white-type mitochondria were observed, and these cells were leptin-positive In obese (db/db) animals, brown fat was composed mainly of small unilocular, UCP-positive adipocytes (mean diameter: 40.08 microns), which were also leptin-positive In summary, classical brown adipocytes differ from white adipocytes, not only by their morphology and UCP expression, but also by their apparent lack of detectable leptin expression

We previously reported that adiposity and serum leptin levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum leptin are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic NPY mRNA by leptin may be impaired with age We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and $T1$$T2$ (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic NPY mRNA by leptin may be impaired with age We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus Leptin infusion diminished hypothalamic NPY levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in senescent rats These diminished responses to leptin were associated with and may be the result of an impaired suppression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of $T1$ on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of $T2$ on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking $T1$-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle $T2$ (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT $T1$$T2$ subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT UCP-3 mRNA to 30-40% of control However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and UCPs appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics

Insulin-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that $T1$ treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and $T2$, are expressed at sufficient levels.

Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic $T1$ Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of $T2$ and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Overexpression of G11alpha and isoforms of phospholipase C in islet  beta-cells reveals a lack of correlation between inositol phosphate  accumulation and insulin secretion. It has been suggested that $T1$ secretion from pancreatic islets may be  mediated in part by activation of $T2$ (PLCs) and  phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The purpose of this study was to determine  whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated insulin secretion responses  of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or  activation of PLC isoforms. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PLC-delta1, -beta1, or  -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement  in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in insulin  secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite  the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell  extracts. Overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets  elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on  insulin secretion. Because the effect of carbachol on insulin secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PLC-beta1  or -beta3. Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect  slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3, but  these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated insulin  secretion.

We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, $T1$ also causes the translocation of $T2$ from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of $T1$$T2$ (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced $T1$ secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the $T2$ (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and phospholipase C (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in $T1$-mediated $T2$ secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on PLC-mediated insulin secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by $T1$$T2$-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

To elucidate the pathophysiologic significance of UCP3 and UCP2 in the effect of TZDs on glucose metabolism and energy expenditure, we examined their basal mRNA levels in the WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle from Wistar fatty rats, a rat model of NIDDM and obesity with leptin receptor defect, and investigated expression of the genes encoding UCP3 and UCP2 in Wistar fatty rats and in Wistar lean rats with 2-week oral administration of 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) pioglitazone, a TZD derivative These results clearly demonstrate that $T1$$T2$ in Wistar fatty rats and in Wistar lean rats with 2-week oral administration of 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) pioglitazone, a TZD derivative These results clearly demonstrate that UCP3 gene expression is upregulated by TZDs in the WAT and BAT in Wistar fatty rats, an obese model with leptin receptor defect, and that adipose UCP3 gene expression is increased in response to TZDs in vitro

We previously reported that adiposity and serum leptin levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum leptin are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic NPY mRNA by leptin may be impaired with age We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus $T1$$T2$ (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic NPY mRNA by leptin may be impaired with age We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus Leptin infusion diminished hypothalamic NPY levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in senescent rats These diminished responses to leptin were associated with and may be the result of an impaired suppression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels

Regulation of insulin secretion via ATP-sensitive K+ channel independent mechanisms: role of phospholipase C The further addition of carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of $T1$ distinct from that activated by glucose, together with K+, 20 mM glucose, plus diazoxide resulted in a sustained amplification of $T2$ secretion from mouse but not rat islets The inability to activate a nutrient- and calcium-regulated phospholipase C isozyme in mouse islets to the same extent as in rat islets appears to account, at least in part, for these different insulin secretory responses under these unique conditions

Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and $T1$ (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in $T2$-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on PLC-mediated insulin secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of $T1$ on $T2$ formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of $T1$ on muscle $T2$ expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for $T1$ at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of $T2$, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not PKC-epsilon, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that PKC activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng oxytocin caused a significant rise not only of insulin but also of glucagon and glucose levels In contrast, nanogram amounts of $T1$ administered ICV cause a rise of $T2$ levels

In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and uncoupling protein genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for $T1$$T2$ genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the leptin gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways

The effects of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inositol phosphate (IP) generation in human myometrial cells were evaluated and compared to the effects of oxytocin In contrast, the potencies of oxytocin to raise IP and [Ca2+]i were similar and independent of extracellular Ca2+, and could be suppressed by pertussis toxin and phorbol ester, but not by verapamil The action of PGF2 alpha depends on extracellular Ca2+, whereas $T1$$T2$ (IP) generation in human myometrial cells were evaluated and compared to the effects of oxytocin In contrast, the potencies of oxytocin to raise IP and [Ca2+]i were similar and independent of extracellular Ca2+, and could be suppressed by pertussis toxin and phorbol ester, but not by verapamil The action of PGF2 alpha depends on extracellular Ca2+, whereas oxytocin activates the G-protein-dependent phospholipase-C-IP3-Ca2+ signal-transducing pathway, complemented by the influx of extracellular Ca2+

Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT $T1$ mRNA to 30-40% of control However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and $T2$ appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics

Gamma-aminobutyric acid mediation of the inhibitory effect of nitric oxide on the arginine vasopressin and oxytocin responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia Previous studies have demonstrated that the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME exerts positive effects on the arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, suggesting inhibitory actions of NO AVP and OT secretory patterns during insulin (0.15 IU/kg, i.v.)-tolerance tests (ITT) were examined in seven normal male subjects with (experimental tests) and without (control test) concomitant treatment with L-NAME (40 micrograms/kg injected plus 50 micrograms/kg infused, i.v.), the GABAergic agent sodium valproate (600 mg in three divided doses orally) or the combination of L-NAME and sodium valproate Insulin-induced hypoglycemia increased by 2-fold (peak vs. baseline) plasma AVP and OT levels These data indicate a GABAergic mediation of the inhibitory modulation by NO of the AVP and $T1$ responses to $T2$-induced hypoglycemia

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and $T1$ in response to $T2$ treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of oxytocin influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both insulin and CCK levels were decreased in response to the oxytocin treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that oxytocin induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and insulin, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

Gibbestatin B inhibits the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of PKC-alpha, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not PKC-epsilon, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that $T1$ activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of $T2$ to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

Insulin-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an $T1$$T2$ has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that insulin treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PLCgamma, are expressed at sufficient levels.

Interleukin-1 beta inhibits phospholipase C and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and insulin secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both $T1$$T2$ secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both PLC as well as Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of $T1$ on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of $T2$ (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and phospholipase Cgamma1 that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation. However, both EGF and $T1$ stimulated the accumulation of $T2$ at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the insulin-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of $T1$ The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The $T2$ Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of PKC-alpha, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not PKC-epsilon, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that PKC activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and $T1$$T2$ in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed Summing up, new evidence suggests that NPY and leptin may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of $T1$ (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on $T2$ formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

$T1$ effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and $T2$ [In Process Citation] Leptin may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic $T1$ Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular $T2$ administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular $T1$ infusion on $T2$ expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Both receive information about the nutritional status and the level of energy storage through insulin and leptin signaling mediated by specific receptors located on POMC and NPY neurons present predominantly in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). When leptin signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the $T1$$T2$ signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the NPY system is upregulated as shown by mRNA overexpression and increased peptide release, whereas the content and/or release of some inhibitory peptides (neurotensin, cholecystokinin) are diminished.

Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and phospholipase C (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in PLC-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on $T1$-mediated $T2$ secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and $T1$$T2$ subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT UCP-3 mRNA to 30-40% of control However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and UCPs appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics

$T1$ (AVP) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) have been shown to stimulate $T2$ (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells However, AVP-induced activation of RSK2, a downstream substrate of ERK1 and ERK2, was PKC-dependent and PI 3-kinase-independent PKC was necessary in AVP- but not in LPA-induced activation of p70 S6K

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of $T1$, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM $T2$ Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not PKC-epsilon, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that PKC activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

Regulation of insulin secretion via ATP-sensitive K+ channel independent mechanisms: role of phospholipase C The further addition of carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of phospholipase C distinct from that activated by glucose, together with K+, 20 mM glucose, plus diazoxide resulted in a sustained amplification of insulin secretion from mouse but not rat islets The inability to activate a nutrient- and calcium-regulated $T1$ isozyme in mouse islets to the same extent as in rat islets appears to account, at least in part, for these different $T2$ secretory responses under these unique conditions

$T1$ secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and phospholipase C (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in $T2$-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on PLC-mediated insulin secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on $T1$ formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of $T2$ Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

C-39 as an inhibitor of the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of $T1$ secretion by information flow in the $T2$/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic Neuropeptide Y Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that $T1$ rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic $T2$ and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Leptin effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and neuropeptide Y [In Process Citation] Leptin may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and $T1$$T2$, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

As expected, in fusion of NPY alone (18 microg/day) augmented food intake (191.6% over the initial control, P < 0.05) and produced a 25.1% weight gain in conjunction with a 10-fold increase in serum leptin concentrations at the end of the 7-day period Interestingly, coinfusion of this regimen of $T1$ with the highly effective anorectic and body reducing effects of CNTF (5.0 microg/day) not only prevented the CNTF-induced anorexia and weight loss, but also normalized serum $T2$ concentrations and hypothalamic NPY gene expression These results demonstrate that chronic central infusion to produce a persistent elevation of the cytokine at pathophysiological levels (a situation that may normally manifest during infection, injury and inflammation) produced severe anorexia and weight loss in conjunction with reduction in both serum leptin concentrations and hypothalamic NPY gene expression

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of $T1$ on the formation of $T2$ and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and phospholipase Cgamma1 that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation. However, both EGF and insulin stimulated the accumulation of phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the $T1$-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with $T2$ at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.

Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and $T1$ (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced $T2$ secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in PLC-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on PLC-mediated insulin secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant $T1$ (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of $T2$ (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

$T1$, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and $T2$ To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

$T1$-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the $T2$ and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that insulin treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PLCgamma, are expressed at sufficient levels.

Amyloid beta protein (25-35) stimulation of phospholipase C in LA-N-2 cells This $T1$ stimulation by $T2$ beta protein appeared to be pertussis toxin sensitive It is possible that this phospholipase C stimulation by amyloid beta protein is a receptor-mediated process Amyloid beta protein stimulation of phospholipase C was absent from LA-N-2 cells previously treated with norepinephrine, trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD), bombesin, or amyloid beta peptide It is suggested that this observed amyloid beta protein stimulation of phospholipase C may be responsible for the elevated quantity of inositol seen in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients

Activation of EGFR overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes leads to a 3.4 +/- 1.2-fold stimulation of $T1$ activity over basal levels vs. only 1.06 +/- 0.01-fold stimulation by $T2$. Despite the low levels of insulin-induced PLC activity, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was similarly inhibited by U73122 (55.9 +/- 13.1% inhibition) Inhibition of PLC activation did not impair either EGF- or insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase or incorporation of glucose into lipid, supporting the hypothesis that both EGF- and insulin-induced glucose disposal can be independent of GLUT4-mediated glucose transport. The diminution of glucose transport secondary to inhibition of PLC activity was reflected by a decrease in GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane upon either EGF or insulin stimulation

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of $T1$ (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of $T2$ Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Influence of obesity and menopausal status on serum leptin, cholecystokinin, galanin and neuropeptide Y levels Obesity occurs in 60% of women after menopause and is characterized by an excess of adipose tissue that depends on several orexigenic (neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates carbohydrate ingestion, galanin stimulates fat intake) and anorectic (leptin, cholecystokinin (CCK)) factors Both leptin and insulin can reduce hypothalamic $T1$$T2$ (NPY) stimulates carbohydrate ingestion, galanin stimulates fat intake) and anorectic (leptin, cholecystokinin (CCK)) factors Both leptin and insulin can reduce hypothalamic NPY production and secretion We investigated basal levels of serum leptin, CCK, galanin and NPY in 16 non-obese premenopausal women, in 15 obese premenopausal women (body mass index (BMI) 34.6 +/- 1.3 SD) and in ten obese postmenopausal women (BMI 34.7 +/- 1.5 SD) to determine the relationship between obesity, menopause and these neuropeptides Significantly increased leptin and galanin levels in postmenopausal obese women coupled with decreased NPY levels revealed some changes in the neuropeptides regulating eating behavior, which may be the reason for the onset of postmenopausal obesity

Relationship among leptin, neuropeptide Y, and galanin in young women and in postmenopausal women [see comments] OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormonal status may affect neuropeptide Y (NPY), galanin, and leptin release in postmenopausal women and in young women CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the differences is plasma leptin, $T1$$T2$ (NPY), galanin, and leptin release in postmenopausal women and in young women CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the differences is plasma leptin, NPY, and galanin between postmenopausal women and young women may be related to body mass index rather than to differences in hormonal status and that the higher NPY levels in both lean and obese postmenopausal women than in young women indicate that factors other than body mass index may be involved

Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic Neuropeptide Y Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to $T1$, $T2$ secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and insulin in response to oxytocin treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of oxytocin influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both $T1$ and CCK levels were decreased in response to the $T2$ treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that oxytocin induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and insulin, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of $T1$ (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic $T2$ that is particularly abundant in the brain

$T1$, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of $T2$, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

NPY-leptin: opposing effects on appetitive and consummatory ingestive behavior and sexual behavior Many studies have indicated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates and leptin inhibits food intake In line with this, intracerebroventricular injection of NPY (10 microg) stimulated and leptin (10 microg) inhibited intake of a sucrose solution when female rats were required to obtain the solution from a bottle However, $T1$$T2$ (NPY) stimulates and leptin inhibits food intake In line with this, intracerebroventricular injection of NPY (10 microg) stimulated and leptin (10 microg) inhibited intake of a sucrose solution when female rats were required to obtain the solution from a bottle However, NPY inhibited and leptin stimulated intake if the solution was infused intraorally Thus NPY stimulates the responses used to obtain food but inhibits those used to consume food, and leptin has the opposite effects

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of $T1$ (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the $T2$ to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle $T1$ subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT UCP-3 mRNA to 30-40% of control However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and $T2$ appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics

We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, AVP also causes the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by $T1$$T2$ activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of $T1$ on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on $T2$ formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic Neuropeptide Y Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as $T1$ (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of $T2$ and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1), oxytocin, prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) on 45Ca2+ mobilization in permeabilized rat myometrial cells and to examine the activation of the inositol lipid cycle in intact myocytes All four agonists caused a biphasic release of 45Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial pool(s), with the rank order of potency: oxytocin > PGF2 alpha > ET-1 > IP3 Endothelin-1 and oxytocin stimulated $T1$$T2$ (IP3) on 45Ca2+ mobilization in permeabilized rat myometrial cells and to examine the activation of the inositol lipid cycle in intact myocytes All four agonists caused a biphasic release of 45Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial pool(s), with the rank order of potency: oxytocin > PGF2 alpha > ET-1 > IP3 Endothelin-1 and oxytocin stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation at concentrations similar to those that promoted 45Ca2+ efflux, whereas about 100 times higher concentrations of PGF2 alpha were needed to activate this signaling pathway in intact cells It is concluded that the primary action of PGF2 alpha in myometrial cells is to enhance Ca2+ influx, whereas oxytocin and ET-1 receptors are coupled to phospholipase C, generating IP3 and raising the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ from intracellular as well as extracellular sources

Further, the oxytocin-induced activation of IK(sl) was effectively antagonized by 5 x 10(-8) mol/l U-73122 or 5 x 10(-6) mol/l 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate (inhibitors of the cell membrane phospholipase C), as well as by intracellularly applied heparin (selective inhibitor of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release channels) The data obtained suggest (i) that selective oxytocin receptors are present on the membranes of guinea-pig antral smooth muscle cells, (ii) that the oxytocin-related relaxation may result from the activation of Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ conductivity via activation of $T1$$T2$ (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release channels) The data obtained suggest (i) that selective oxytocin receptors are present on the membranes of guinea-pig antral smooth muscle cells, (ii) that the oxytocin-related relaxation may result from the activation of Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ conductivity via activation of IP3-induced release of Ca2+ from the submembrane located cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores and (iii) in turn, this evokes a non-inactivating component of IK, hyperpolarizing the cell membrane

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of $T1$ encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the $T2$ to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

Melatonin inhibits $T1$ response to $T2$-induced hypoglycemia, but not to angiotensin II in normal men In order to establish whether melatonin alters basal and/or stimulated oxytocin secretion, 18 normal men were treated (p.o.) with 6 or 12 mg melatonin or placebo in basal conditions (N-6 subjects) or concomitantly to the administration of insulin (O.15 IU/kg body weight in an i.v. bolus) (N-6 subjects) or angiotensin II (increasing doses of 4, 8 and 16 ng/kg/min, at intervals of 20 min) In contrast, the oxytocin response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was significantly reduced by melatonin treatment
