Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen.

Signal transduction of arginine vasopressin-induced arachidonic acid release in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts: role of Ca2+ and the protein kinase C-dependent activation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 or ionomycin, mimicked the effect of AVP, whereas the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, TPA, only induced a slight increase in AA release Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells; PKC inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of $T1$$T2$-induced arachidonic acid release in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts: role of Ca2+ and the protein kinase C-dependent activation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 or ionomycin, mimicked the effect of AVP, whereas the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, TPA, only induced a slight increase in AA release Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells; PKC inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta by long-term (24 h) TPA treatment caused a partial blockade of the AVP-induced response, whereas the A23187-induced AA release was unaffected by down-regulation of these isoforms AVP- or TPA-induced activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK were completely blocked by down-regulation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta, but still occurred, together with the cytosolic PLA2 mobility shift, in the absence of external Ca2+ These results show that AVP-induced AA release in H9c2 cells is secondary to activation of the V1 receptor/Gq protein/PLCP pathway, leading to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and activation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta
