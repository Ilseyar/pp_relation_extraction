Aggregated beta amyloid peptide 1-40 decreases Ca2+- and cholinergic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide degradation by alteration of membrane and cytosolic phospholipase C in brain cortex The effects of full-length amyloid beta protein, A(beta) (1-40), on phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) were investigated in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) and cytosol prepared from the cerebral cortex of adult rats Aggregated A(beta) also decreased significantly the level of diacylglycerol, the product of PLC This additionally supports the inhibitory effect of A(beta) on membrane-bound and cytosolic PLC Moreover, $T1$ significantly decreased the basal activity of the $T2$ in SPM and the enzyme activity regulated through cholinergic receptors

Insulin-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an $T1$$T2$ has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that insulin treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PLCgamma, are expressed at sufficient levels.

Insulin-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that $T1$ treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and $T2$, are expressed at sufficient levels.
