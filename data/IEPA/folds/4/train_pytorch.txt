Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced $T1$ secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the $T2$ (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of $T1$ and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of $T2$ Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic Neuropeptide Y Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to $T1$, $T2$ secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of $T1$ on glucose utilization and on the expression of $T2$ may be mediated through central mechanism

The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1), oxytocin, prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) on 45Ca2+ mobilization in permeabilized rat myometrial cells and to examine the activation of the inositol lipid cycle in intact myocytes All four agonists caused a biphasic release of 45Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial pool(s), with the rank order of potency: oxytocin > PGF2 alpha > ET-1 > IP3 Endothelin-1 and oxytocin stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation at concentrations similar to those that promoted 45Ca2+ efflux, whereas about 100 times higher concentrations of PGF2 alpha were needed to activate this signaling pathway in intact cells It is concluded that the primary action of PGF2 alpha in myometrial cells is to enhance Ca2+ influx, whereas $T1$ and ET-1 receptors are coupled to phospholipase C, generating $T2$ and raising the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ from intracellular as well as extracellular sources

Leptin effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and neuropeptide Y [In Process Citation] $T1$ may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of $T2$ (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of $T1$ induced by $T2$ and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Insulin-like signaling in yeast: modulation of protein phosphatase 2A, protein kinase A, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activities In addition, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by insulin, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus insulin in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the GPI-PLC $T1$ was most pronouncedly stimulated by authentic human $T2$ compared to various insulin analogues and insulin-like growth factor I As the GPI-PLC reaction is rate limiting, the efficiency of the two-step anchor cleavage was significantly increased when insulin was present together with glucose as compared to glucose alone The insulin concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation The data suggest that mammalian insulin-sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC) involved in the transduction of the insulin signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase

UCP2, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats $T1$ increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased $T2$ mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and insulin in response to oxytocin treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of oxytocin influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both insulin and CCK levels were decreased in response to the oxytocin treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that $T1$ induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and $T2$, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative $T1$ expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of $T2$ may be mediated through central mechanism

Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and phospholipase Cgamma1 that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation. However, both EGF and $T1$ stimulated the accumulation of $T2$ at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the insulin-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of $T1$ secretion by information flow in the $T2$/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and $T1$ had no effect on the formation of $T2$ (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

UCP2, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, $T1$ (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats $T2$ increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with $T1$ causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and $T2$ that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation. However, both EGF and insulin stimulated the accumulation of phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the insulin-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.

The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on $T1$-induced $T2$ secretion was difficult to evaluate Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng oxytocin caused a significant rise not only of insulin but also of glucagon and glucose levels In contrast, nanogram amounts of oxytocin administered ICV cause a rise of insulin levels

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular $T1$ infusion on $T2$ expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of $T1$ (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of $T2$ on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the $T1$ to modulate the activity of $T2$, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

$T1$ effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and $T2$ [In Process Citation] Leptin may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hCG, hCG plus oxytocin and oxytocin on [3H] inositol phosphate (IP) formations in porcine myometrial cells obtained from ovariectomized and cyclic gilts The highest production of total inositol phosphates (d.p.m.) was found in cells from ovariectomized gilts given in vivo estradiol benzoate and progesterone for five consecutive days and treated with 1000 mU hCG and 100 mU hCG plus 1 microM oxytocin (984 +/- 84 and 1063 +/- 131 vs 314 +/- 36, respectively) There was also a very significant increase of IP1 after the addition of 1000 mU hCG (p < 0.001) and IP1 and IP3 when 1000 mU hCG plus oxytocin were added (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively) Only oxytocin alone increased the formation of $T1$$T2$ when 1000 mU hCG plus oxytocin were added (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively) Only oxytocin alone increased the formation of IPs in cells from ovariectomized pigs treated with estradiol in vivo (p < 0.01) The highest dose of hCG plus The highest dose of hCG plus oxytocin provoked accumulation of total [3H]inositol phosphate (p < 0.05) 53% over the basal level on days 21/1 of the estrous cycle The present study demonstrates that hCG and oxytocin can increase the accumulation of inositol phosphates in porcine myometrial cells

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking $T1$-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle $T2$ (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

We propose that $T1$ binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate ($T2$)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial IP3 was increased within 30 seconds after OT treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that OT stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding IP3 and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

We have studied the effects of neomycin, a potent inhibitor of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC), on the germination of rice seed and the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in the aleurone layer and the scutellar tissues It was shown that, in the absence of exogenous Ca2+, neomycin markedly reduced the germination speed and seedling growth of rice seeds and inhibited the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ in both secretory tissues These results strongly suggest that the phosphoinositide-Ca2+ signal transduction pathway may play an important role in the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase molecules closely related to the germination processes of rice seed

Gibbestatin B inhibits the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Roles of GTP and phospholipase C in the potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion by glucose in rat pancreatic islets There was a 98% greater augmentation of insulin secretion by 16.7 mM glucose (in the presence of diazoxide and 40 mM K+) in primed islets; however, the ability of high glucose to augment PLC activity bore no relationship to the secretory response MPA markedly inhibited PLC in both conditions; however, $T1$$T2$ activity bore no relationship to the secretory response MPA markedly inhibited PLC in both conditions; however, insulin secretion was only inhibited (by 46%) in primed islets These data indicate that an adequate level of GTP is critical for glucose's potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion in primed islets but that PLC activation can clearly be dissociated from insulin secretion and therefore cannot be the major cause of glucose's augmentation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion

Fasting and leptin modulate adipose and muscle uncoupling protein: divergent effects between messenger ribonucleic acid and protein expression In this study, we examined the effects of fasting for 2 days and exogenous s.c. leptin, 200 microg every 8 h for 2 days, on the regulation of uncoupling protein (UCP) subtypes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gastrocnemius muscle $T1$, compared with vehicle, did not alter BAT UCP-1 or UCP-3 mRNA or protein expression when administered to normal ad libitum fed rats Fasting significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 and UCP-3 mRNA expression, to 31% and 30% of ad libitum fed controls, respectively, effects which were prevented by administration of leptin to fasted rats Fasting also significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 protein expression, to 67% of control; however, that effect was not prevented by leptin treatment Fasting, with or without leptin administration, did not affect BAT UCP-2 mRNA; however, leptin administration to ad libitum fed rats significantly increased BAT UCP-2 mRNA, to 138% of control Fasting significantly enhanced gastrocnemius muscle UCP-3 mRNA (411% of control) and protein expression (168% of control), whereas leptin administration to fasted rats did not alter either of these effects In summary, $T2$ subtype mRNA and protein are regulated in tissue- and subtype-specific fashion by leptin and food restriction

Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed Summing up, new evidence suggests that $T1$ and $T2$ may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level

We previously reported that adiposity and serum leptin levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum leptin are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic $T1$ mRNA by $T2$ may be impaired with age We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus Leptin infusion diminished hypothalamic NPY levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in senescent rats These diminished responses to leptin were associated with and may be the result of an impaired suppression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for $T1$, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of $T2$ may be mediated through central mechanism

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of $T1$ (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on $T2$ formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and phospholipase Cgamma1 that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation. However, both EGF and insulin stimulated the accumulation of phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the $T1$-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with $T2$ at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of $T1$ on muscle $T2$ expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) have been shown to stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells However, AVP-induced activation of RSK2, a downstream substrate of ERK1 and ERK2, was PKC-dependent and PI 3-kinase-independent PKC was necessary in $T1$$T2$ (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells However, AVP-induced activation of RSK2, a downstream substrate of ERK1 and ERK2, was PKC-dependent and PI 3-kinase-independent PKC was necessary in AVP- but not in LPA-induced activation of p70 S6K

Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and $T1$, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), $T2$ (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, UCP-2, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for $T1$, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in $T2$-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of UCPs may be mediated through central mechanism

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by $T1$$T2$-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Molecular characterization of catalytic-subunit cDNA sequences encoding protein phosphatases 1 and 2A and study of their roles in the gibberellin-dependent Osamy-c expression in rice To understand the molecular mechanism of gibberellin-dependent gene regulation, the effect of three phosphatase inhibitors on the germination of rice seeds and the expression of a target gene, the alpha-amylase gene, Osamy-c, were measured To further understand the possible role of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in the $T1$-dependent expression of $T2$, we isolated cDNA clones encoding protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A from a rice aleurone cDNA library Taken together, our results suggest that protein phosphatases PP1 or PP2A are involved in the GA-dependent expression of the rice Osamy-c gene, though the PP1 or/and PP2A enzymatic activities as well as mRNA levels do not increase upon GA3 treatment

The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms Subcutaneous injections of $T1$ increased $T2$, glucagon and glucose levels significantly Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng oxytocin caused a significant rise not only of insulin but also of glucagon and glucose levels In contrast, nanogram amounts of oxytocin administered ICV cause a rise of insulin levels

Effect of residual endogenous insulin secretion on the abnormal oxytocin response to hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetics Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous insulin secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates OT secretion DESIGN: Case-control study: the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous insulin secretion Blood samples for OT assay were taken just before the rapid injection of insulin (time 0) and at time 15, 30, 45 and 60 min CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a residual endogenous $T1$ secretion exerts a partial protective action against the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder affecting the $T2$ secretory system in IDDM

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of $T1$ on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on $T2$ formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of $T1$$T2$ (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

Insulin-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with $T1$$T2$ has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that insulin treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PLCgamma, are expressed at sufficient levels.

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of $T1$ on muscle $T2$ expression

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for $T1$ and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of $T2$ may be mediated through central mechanism

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. $T1$ infusion also favored the expression of $T2$ in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1), oxytocin, prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) on 45Ca2+ mobilization in permeabilized rat myometrial cells and to examine the activation of the inositol lipid cycle in intact myocytes All four agonists caused a biphasic release of 45Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial pool(s), with the rank order of potency: oxytocin > PGF2 alpha > ET-1 > IP3 Endothelin-1 and $T1$ stimulated $T2$ accumulation at concentrations similar to those that promoted 45Ca2+ efflux, whereas about 100 times higher concentrations of PGF2 alpha were needed to activate this signaling pathway in intact cells It is concluded that the primary action of PGF2 alpha in myometrial cells is to enhance Ca2+ influx, whereas oxytocin and ET-1 receptors are coupled to phospholipase C, generating IP3 and raising the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ from intracellular as well as extracellular sources

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of $T1$ in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by $T2$ (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of $T1$ on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of $T2$ on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

$T1$-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the $T2$ and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that insulin treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PLCgamma, are expressed at sufficient levels.

Fasting and leptin modulate adipose and muscle $T1$: divergent effects between messenger ribonucleic acid and protein expression In this study, we examined the effects of fasting for 2 days and exogenous s.c. leptin, 200 microg every 8 h for 2 days, on the regulation of uncoupling protein (UCP) subtypes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gastrocnemius muscle Leptin, compared with vehicle, did not alter BAT UCP-1 or UCP-3 mRNA or protein expression when administered to normal ad libitum fed rats Fasting significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 and UCP-3 mRNA expression, to 31% and 30% of ad libitum fed controls, respectively, effects which were prevented by administration of leptin to fasted rats Fasting also significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 protein expression, to 67% of control; however, that effect was not prevented by leptin treatment Fasting, with or without leptin administration, did not affect BAT $T2$ mRNA; however, leptin administration to ad libitum fed rats significantly increased BAT UCP-2 mRNA, to 138% of control Fasting significantly enhanced gastrocnemius muscle UCP-3 mRNA (411% of control) and protein expression (168% of control), whereas leptin administration to fasted rats did not alter either of these effects In summary, UCP subtype mRNA and protein are regulated in tissue- and subtype-specific fashion by leptin and food restriction

The expression of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 were up-regulated by 3.2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, during the late stage of pregnancy with an increase of WAT leptin mRNA expression and exogenous administration of leptin resulted in induction of the uterine UCP2 and $T1$ levels These results indicate that $T2$ gene expressions during pregnancy are regulated tissue-dependently, and up-regulation of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA may be due to increased leptin levels

In normal pancreatic islets, $T1$ is upregulated by $T2$ and is low in leptin-resistant islets of ZDF rats To determine whether UCP-2 does, in fact, have uncoupling activity and, if so, whether such activity would favorably influence the abnormalities in leptin-unresponsive UCP-2-underexpressing islets of diabetic ZDF rats, we transferred the UCP-2 gene to the islets of diabetic ZDF rats and lean (+/+) ZDF control rats We conclude that UCP-2 has uncoupling function when overexpressed in leptin-insensitive islets and that its overexpression corrects the underexpression of the insulin gene and ameliorates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, possibly by increasing the ATP:ADP ratio

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on $T1$ expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in $T2$ To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and insulin in response to oxytocin treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of $T1$ influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), $T2$ and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both insulin and CCK levels were decreased in response to the oxytocin treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that oxytocin induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and insulin, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

We have studied the effects of neomycin, a potent inhibitor of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC), on the germination of rice seed and the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ in the aleurone layer and the scutellar tissues It was shown that, in the absence of exogenous Ca2+, neomycin markedly reduced the germination speed and seedling growth of rice seeds and inhibited the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in both secretory tissues These results strongly suggest that the phosphoinositide-Ca2+ signal transduction pathway may play an important role in the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase molecules closely related to the germination processes of rice seed

Insulin-like signaling in yeast: modulation of protein phosphatase 2A, protein kinase A, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activities In addition, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by insulin, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus insulin in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the GPI-PLC GPI-PLC was most pronouncedly stimulated by authentic human insulin compared to various insulin analogues and insulin-like growth factor I As the GPI-PLC reaction is rate limiting, the efficiency of the two-step anchor cleavage was significantly increased when insulin was present together with glucose as compared to glucose alone The $T1$ concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and $T2$ activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation The data suggest that mammalian insulin-sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC) involved in the transduction of the insulin signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of $T1$ on the formation of $T2$ and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial $T1$ was increased within 30 seconds after $T2$ treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that OT stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding IP3 and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

OT may rapidly stimulate inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) formation, consistent with the concept of rapid activation of a second-messenger system In support of this hypothesis, endometrial $T1$ levels were increased (P < 0.05) within 0.5 min after treatment with 0.1 microM $T2$ These results indicate that OT induces endometrial IP3 production in a rapid manner indicative of a second-messenger system

We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, AVP also causes the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by $T1$$T2$ activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng $T1$ caused a significant rise not only of $T2$ but also of glucagon and glucose levels In contrast, nanogram amounts of oxytocin administered ICV cause a rise of insulin levels

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of $T1$ and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on $T2$ formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Leptin increases uncoupling protein expression and energy expenditure Leptin increased BAT UCP mRNA levels greater than twofold in both ad libitum-fed and food-restricted rats These data demonstrate a leptin-induced increase in energy expenditure in nonmutant rodents and suggest that one mechanism by which leptin increases energy expenditure is through increased thermogenesis in BAT, including increased expression of $T1$$T2$ expression and energy expenditure Leptin increased BAT UCP mRNA levels greater than twofold in both ad libitum-fed and food-restricted rats These data demonstrate a leptin-induced increase in energy expenditure in nonmutant rodents and suggest that one mechanism by which leptin increases energy expenditure is through increased thermogenesis in BAT, including increased expression of UCP

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of $T1$, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not $T2$, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that PKC activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic $T1$ secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of $T2$ distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Both receive information about the nutritional status and the level of energy storage through insulin and leptin signaling mediated by specific receptors located on POMC and NPY neurons present predominantly in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). When leptin signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the $T1$$T2$ signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the NPY system is upregulated as shown by mRNA overexpression and increased peptide release, whereas the content and/or release of some inhibitory peptides (neurotensin, cholecystokinin) are diminished.

Immunohistochemical localization of leptin and uncoupling protein in white and brown adipose tissue To establish the cell type expressing leptin, we also assessed the size and organization of lipid droplets, the ultrastructural features of mitochondria, and the presence or absence of uncoupling protein, a brown fat-specific marker In brown adipose tissue of lean animals, multilocular uncoupling protein (UCP)-positive brown adipocytes had typical brown mitochondria and were leptin-negative, both in fed and fasted conditions At the periphery of the interscapular brown adipose tissue depot, unilocular, $T1$$T2$, a brown fat-specific marker In brown adipose tissue of lean animals, multilocular uncoupling protein (UCP)-positive brown adipocytes had typical brown mitochondria and were leptin-negative, both in fed and fasted conditions At the periphery of the interscapular brown adipose tissue depot, unilocular, UCP-negative adipocytes (mean diameter: 41.55 microns) with white-type mitochondria were observed, and these cells were leptin-positive In obese (db/db) animals, brown fat was composed mainly of small unilocular, UCP-positive adipocytes (mean diameter: 40.08 microns), which were also leptin-positive In summary, classical brown adipocytes differ from white adipocytes, not only by their morphology and UCP expression, but also by their apparent lack of detectable leptin expression

We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial IP3 was increased within 30 seconds after OT treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that $T1$ stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding $T2$ and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

Gamma-aminobutyric acid mediation of the inhibitory effect of nitric oxide on the arginine vasopressin and oxytocin responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia Previous studies have demonstrated that the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME exerts positive effects on the arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, suggesting inhibitory actions of NO AVP and OT secretory patterns during insulin (0.15 IU/kg, i.v.)-tolerance tests (ITT) were examined in seven normal male subjects with (experimental tests) and without (control test) concomitant treatment with L-NAME (40 micrograms/kg injected plus 50 micrograms/kg infused, i.v.), the GABAergic agent sodium valproate (600 mg in three divided doses orally) or the combination of L-NAME and sodium valproate Insulin-induced hypoglycemia increased by 2-fold (peak vs. baseline) plasma AVP and OT levels These data indicate a GABAergic mediation of the inhibitory modulation by NO of the AVP and $T1$ responses to $T2$-induced hypoglycemia

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Leptin effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and neuropeptide Y [In Process Citation] Leptin may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and $T1$$T2$, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

UCP2, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats $T1$ increased LPL mRNA by 80%, $T2$ mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and insulin in response to oxytocin treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of oxytocin influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both $T1$ and CCK levels were decreased in response to the $T2$ treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that oxytocin induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and insulin, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of $T1$ is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of $T2$ secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Aggregated beta amyloid peptide 1-40 decreases Ca2+- and cholinergic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide degradation by alteration of membrane and cytosolic phospholipase C in brain cortex The effects of full-length amyloid beta protein, A(beta) (1-40), on phosphoinositide-specific $T1$ (PLC) were investigated in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) and cytosol prepared from the cerebral cortex of adult rats Aggregated A(beta) also decreased significantly the level of diacylglycerol, the product of PLC This additionally supports the inhibitory effect of A(beta) on membrane-bound and cytosolic PLC Moreover, A(beta) (1-40) significantly decreased the basal activity of the $T2$ in SPM and the enzyme activity regulated through cholinergic receptors

In the fasting state UCP-2 expression correlated inversely with body mass index (r = -0.45; P = 0.026), percent body fat (r = -0.41; P = 0.05), plasma insulin (r = -0.47; P = 0.02), epigastric venous fatty acids (r = -0.45; P = 0.04), and leptin (r = -0.50; P = 0.018) $T1$ expression remained inversely related with plasma $T2$ after controlling for percent body (r = -0.45; P = 0.038) In conclusion, 1) UCP-2 messenger ribonucleic acid expression in sc adipose tissue is inversely related to adiposity and independently linked to local plasma leptin levels; and 2) UCP-2 expression is not acutely regulated by food intake, insulin, or fatty acids

Amyloid beta protein (25-35) stimulation of phospholipase C in LA-N-2 cells This phospholipase C stimulation by amyloid beta protein appeared to be pertussis toxin sensitive It is possible that this phospholipase C stimulation by amyloid beta protein is a receptor-mediated process $T1$ beta protein stimulation of $T2$ was absent from LA-N-2 cells previously treated with norepinephrine, trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD), bombesin, or amyloid beta peptide It is suggested that this observed amyloid beta protein stimulation of phospholipase C may be responsible for the elevated quantity of inositol seen in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of $T1$ on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of $T2$ Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant $T1$ (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of $T2$ (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

Gamma-aminobutyric acid mediation of the inhibitory effect of nitric oxide on the arginine vasopressin and $T1$ responses to $T2$-induced hypoglycemia Previous studies have demonstrated that the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME exerts positive effects on the arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, suggesting inhibitory actions of NO AVP and OT secretory patterns during insulin (0.15 IU/kg, i.v.)-tolerance tests (ITT) were examined in seven normal male subjects with (experimental tests) and without (control test) concomitant treatment with L-NAME (40 micrograms/kg injected plus 50 micrograms/kg infused, i.v.), the GABAergic agent sodium valproate (600 mg in three divided doses orally) or the combination of L-NAME and sodium valproate Insulin-induced hypoglycemia increased by 2-fold (peak vs. baseline) plasma AVP and OT levels These data indicate a GABAergic mediation of the inhibitory modulation by NO of the AVP and OT responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia

We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, $T1$ also causes the translocation of $T2$ from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and uncoupling protein genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the $T1$$T2$ genes and the leptin gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV $T1$ was unable to maintain muscle $T2$ expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Insulin-like signaling in yeast: modulation of protein phosphatase 2A, protein kinase A, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific $T1$ activities In addition, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by $T2$, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus insulin in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the GPI-PLC GPI-PLC was most pronouncedly stimulated by authentic human insulin compared to various insulin analogues and insulin-like growth factor I As the GPI-PLC reaction is rate limiting, the efficiency of the two-step anchor cleavage was significantly increased when insulin was present together with glucose as compared to glucose alone The insulin concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation The data suggest that mammalian insulin-sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC) involved in the transduction of the insulin signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase

Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of $T1$$T2$ in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed Summing up, new evidence suggests that NPY and leptin may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the $T1$ (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of $T2$ in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that $T1$ treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and $T2$, are expressed at sufficient levels.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hCG, hCG plus oxytocin and oxytocin on [3H] inositol phosphate (IP) formations in porcine myometrial cells obtained from ovariectomized and cyclic gilts The highest production of total inositol phosphates (d.p.m.) was found in cells from ovariectomized gilts given in vivo estradiol benzoate and progesterone for five consecutive days and treated with 1000 mU hCG and 100 mU hCG plus 1 microM oxytocin (984 +/- 84 and 1063 +/- 131 vs 314 +/- 36, respectively) There was also a very significant increase of IP1 after the addition of 1000 mU hCG (p < 0.001) and IP1 and $T1$ when 1000 mU hCG plus $T2$ were added (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively) Only oxytocin alone increased the formation of IPs in cells from ovariectomized pigs treated with estradiol in vivo (p < 0.01) The highest dose of hCG plus The highest dose of hCG plus oxytocin provoked accumulation of total [3H]inositol phosphate (p < 0.05) 53% over the basal level on days 21/1 of the estrous cycle The present study demonstrates that hCG and oxytocin can increase the accumulation of inositol phosphates in porcine myometrial cells

Fasting and leptin modulate adipose and muscle uncoupling protein: divergent effects between messenger ribonucleic acid and protein expression In this study, we examined the effects of fasting for 2 days and exogenous s.c. leptin, 200 microg every 8 h for 2 days, on the regulation of uncoupling protein (UCP) subtypes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gastrocnemius muscle Leptin, compared with vehicle, did not alter BAT UCP-1 or $T1$$T2$, compared with vehicle, did not alter BAT UCP-1 or UCP-3 mRNA or protein expression when administered to normal ad libitum fed rats Fasting significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 and UCP-3 mRNA expression, to 31% and 30% of ad libitum fed controls, respectively, effects which were prevented by administration of leptin to fasted rats Fasting also significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 protein expression, to 67% of control; however, that effect was not prevented by leptin treatment Fasting, with or without leptin administration, did not affect BAT UCP-2 mRNA; however, leptin administration to ad libitum fed rats significantly increased BAT UCP-2 mRNA, to 138% of control Fasting significantly enhanced gastrocnemius muscle UCP-3 mRNA (411% of control) and protein expression (168% of control), whereas leptin administration to fasted rats did not alter either of these effects In summary, UCP subtype mRNA and protein are regulated in tissue- and subtype-specific fashion by leptin and food restriction

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of $T1$ (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of $T2$ Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Tolbutamide and diazoxide modulate $T1$-linked Ca(2+) signaling and $T2$ secretion in beta-cells We examined whether tolbutamide and diazoxide, which close or open ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP) channels), respectively, interact with PLC-linked Ca(2+) signals in HIT-T15 and mouse beta-cells and with PLC-linked insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells Thus tolbutamide and diazoxide regulate both PLC-linked Ca(2+) signaling and insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by modulating K(ATP) channels, thereby determining voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) influx

We have studied the effects of neomycin, a potent inhibitor of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC), on the germination of rice seed and the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in the aleurone layer and the scutellar tissues It was shown that, in the absence of exogenous Ca2+, neomycin markedly reduced the germination speed and seedling growth of rice seeds and inhibited the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in both secretory tissues These results strongly suggest that the phosphoinositide-Ca2+ signal transduction pathway may play an important role in the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ molecules closely related to the germination processes of rice seed

The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1), oxytocin, prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) on 45Ca2+ mobilization in permeabilized rat myometrial cells and to examine the activation of the inositol lipid cycle in intact myocytes All four agonists caused a biphasic release of 45Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial pool(s), with the rank order of potency: oxytocin > PGF2 alpha > ET-1 > IP3 Endothelin-1 and oxytocin stimulated $T1$$T2$ Endothelin-1 and oxytocin stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation at concentrations similar to those that promoted 45Ca2+ efflux, whereas about 100 times higher concentrations of PGF2 alpha were needed to activate this signaling pathway in intact cells It is concluded that the primary action of PGF2 alpha in myometrial cells is to enhance Ca2+ influx, whereas oxytocin and ET-1 receptors are coupled to phospholipase C, generating IP3 and raising the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ from intracellular as well as extracellular sources

The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly Two nanograms $T1$ given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in $T2$ levels at this time point The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng oxytocin caused a significant rise not only of insulin but also of glucagon and glucose levels In contrast, nanogram amounts of oxytocin administered ICV cause a rise of insulin levels

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of $T1$-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA $T2$ transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of $T1$ prevented such a decrease in $T2$ To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for $T1$$T2$ expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of UCPs may be mediated through central mechanism

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and $T1$ in response to $T2$ treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of oxytocin influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both insulin and CCK levels were decreased in response to the oxytocin treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that oxytocin induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and insulin, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

Insulin-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an $T1$$T2$ has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that insulin treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PLCgamma, are expressed at sufficient levels.

Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of $T1$ on $T2$ formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

$T1$ beta protein (25-35) stimulation of $T2$ A, C and D activities of LA-N-2 cells [3H]Inositol prelabeled LA-N-2 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of A beta P, from 20 to 125 micrograms/ml, and phospholipase C activation was measured The effects of adrenergic, metabotropic amino acid and bombesin antagonists on the A beta P mediated stimulation of phospholipase C activity was investigated Propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist, 7-chloro-kynurenic acid, a metabotropic amino acid antagonist, and [Tyr4-D-Phe12]bombesin, a bombesin antagonist, blunted the A beta P stimulation of phospholipase C activity in [3H]inositol prelabeled LA-N-2 cells This suggests that amyloid beta protein activation of phospholipase C may be receptor mediated The phospholipase C inhibitor U 71322 prevented the activation of phospholipase C by A beta P

NPY-leptin: opposing effects on appetitive and consummatory ingestive behavior and sexual behavior Many studies have indicated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates and leptin inhibits food intake In line with this, intracerebroventricular injection of NPY (10 microg) stimulated and leptin (10 microg) inhibited intake of a sucrose solution when female rats were required to obtain the solution from a bottle However, $T1$$T2$ (NPY) stimulates and leptin inhibits food intake In line with this, intracerebroventricular injection of NPY (10 microg) stimulated and leptin (10 microg) inhibited intake of a sucrose solution when female rats were required to obtain the solution from a bottle However, NPY inhibited and leptin stimulated intake if the solution was infused intraorally Thus NPY stimulates the responses used to obtain food but inhibits those used to consume food, and leptin has the opposite effects

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The $T1$ Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of PKC-alpha, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not PKC-epsilon, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that $T2$ activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen.

Oxytocin-stimulated insulin release in a clonal beta-cell line RINm5F: involvement of phospholipase C-dependent and -independent pathways. CONCLUSION: Oxy increases insulin release through both PLC and non-PLC mediated signal transduction mechanisms. In addition, U-73122 diminished the Oxy-induced increase in intracellular concentration of inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3) U-73122 at 8 mumol.L-1 totally abolished the Oxy-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3; however it reduced the Oxy-induced increase in insulin release only by 36% and 63% in the monolayer and suspended cell preparations, respectively Oxytocin-stimulated insulin release in a clonal beta-cell line RINm5F: involvement of phospholipase C-dependent and -independent pathways AIM: To study the mechanisms underlying oxytocin (Oxy)-induced insulin release RESULTS: Oxy increased insulin release and [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner $T1$-induced $T2$ release was not altered by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PT) U-73122 at 8 mumol.L-1 totally abolished the Oxy-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3; however it reduced the Oxy-induced increase in insulin release only by 36% and 63% in the monolayer and suspended cell preparations, respectively CONCLUSION: Oxy increases insulin release through both PLC and non-PLC mediated signal transduction mechanisms

Oxytocin (OT) is more expressed in the TEC/TNC than vasopressin (VP); insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) thymic expression predominates over IGF-1, and much more over (pro)insulin Thus, OT was proposed to be the self antigen of the neurohypophysial family, and IGF-2 the self antigen precursor of the $T1$$T2$ was proposed to be the self antigen of the neurohypophysial family, and IGF-2 the self antigen precursor of the insulin family

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hCG, hCG plus oxytocin and oxytocin on [3H] inositol phosphate (IP) formations in porcine myometrial cells obtained from ovariectomized and cyclic gilts The highest production of total inositol phosphates (d.p.m.) was found in cells from ovariectomized gilts given in vivo estradiol benzoate and progesterone for five consecutive days and treated with 1000 mU hCG and 100 mU hCG plus 1 microM oxytocin (984 +/- 84 and 1063 +/- 131 vs 314 +/- 36, respectively) There was also a very significant increase of IP1 after the addition of 1000 mU hCG (p < 0.001) and IP1 and IP3 when 1000 mU hCG plus oxytocin were added (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively) Only oxytocin alone increased the formation of $T1$ in cells from ovariectomized pigs treated with estradiol in vivo (p < 0.01) The highest dose of hCG plus The highest dose of hCG plus oxytocin provoked accumulation of total [3H]$T2$ (p < 0.05) 53% over the basal level on days 21/1 of the estrous cycle The present study demonstrates that hCG and oxytocin can increase the accumulation of inositol phosphates in porcine myometrial cells

Downregulation of uncoupling protein 2 mRNA in white adipose tissue and uncoupling protein 3 mRNA in skeletal muscle during the early stages of leptin treatment $T1$$T2$ mRNA in skeletal muscle during the early stages of leptin treatment Leptin by intravenous or intracerebroventricular infusion for 5 h was associated with a decrease in UCP-2 mRNA in WAT (47-52%) and UCP-3 mRNA in SM (33-37%) Denervation suppressed mRNA levels for UCP-2 (49%), UCP-3 (36%), and COX-IV (59%) and eliminated the acute response to leptin in SM

Fasting and leptin modulate adipose and muscle uncoupling protein: divergent effects between messenger ribonucleic acid and protein expression In this study, we examined the effects of fasting for 2 days and exogenous s.c. leptin, 200 microg every 8 h for 2 days, on the regulation of uncoupling protein (UCP) subtypes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gastrocnemius muscle Leptin, compared with vehicle, did not alter BAT UCP-1 or UCP-3 mRNA or protein expression when administered to normal ad libitum fed rats Fasting significantly decreased BAT $T1$ and UCP-3 mRNA expression, to 31% and 30% of ad libitum fed controls, respectively, effects which were prevented by administration of $T2$ to fasted rats Fasting also significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 protein expression, to 67% of control; however, that effect was not prevented by leptin treatment Fasting, with or without leptin administration, did not affect BAT UCP-2 mRNA; however, leptin administration to ad libitum fed rats significantly increased BAT UCP-2 mRNA, to 138% of control Fasting significantly enhanced gastrocnemius muscle UCP-3 mRNA (411% of control) and protein expression (168% of control), whereas leptin administration to fasted rats did not alter either of these effects In summary, UCP subtype mRNA and protein are regulated in tissue- and subtype-specific fashion by leptin and food restriction

$T1$ Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic Neuropeptide Y Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of $T2$ and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone
