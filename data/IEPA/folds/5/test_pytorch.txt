Correlation between the stimulatory effect of $T1$ on the formation of $T2$ and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition

Oxytocin-stimulated inositol phosphate turnover in endometrium of ewes is influenced by stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and intrauterine infusion of ovine conceptus secretory proteins Three experiments (Exp) assessed the influence of stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and intrauterine infusion of ovine conceptus secretory proteins (oCSP) on turnover of inositol trisphosphate (the putative second-messenger for oxytocin-stimulated secretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha) in ovine endometrium during luteolysis and maternal recognition of pregnancy For each Exp, 100 mg endometrium was incubated, in duplicate, for 2 h with 10 microCi [3H] inositol and treated with 0 or 100 nM oxytocin (OT) for 20 min, then [3H]inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (IP1, IP2, and $T1$$T2$ (the putative second-messenger for oxytocin-stimulated secretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha) in ovine endometrium during luteolysis and maternal recognition of pregnancy For each Exp, 100 mg endometrium was incubated, in duplicate, for 2 h with 10 microCi [3H] inositol and treated with 0 or 100 nM oxytocin (OT) for 20 min, then [3H]inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (IP1, IP2, and IP3, respectively) were quantified

Regulation of insulin secretion via ATP-sensitive K+ channel independent mechanisms: role of phospholipase C The further addition of carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of phospholipase C distinct from that activated by glucose, together with K+, 20 mM glucose, plus diazoxide resulted in a sustained amplification of insulin secretion from mouse but not rat islets The inability to activate a nutrient- and calcium-regulated $T1$ isozyme in mouse islets to the same extent as in rat islets appears to account, at least in part, for these different $T2$ secretory responses under these unique conditions
