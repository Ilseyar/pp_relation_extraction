UCP2, $T1$ and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of $T2$, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

Roles of GTP and phospholipase C in the potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion by glucose in rat pancreatic islets There was a 98% greater augmentation of insulin secretion by 16.7 mM glucose (in the presence of diazoxide and 40 mM K+) in primed islets; however, the ability of high glucose to augment $T1$$T2$ in the potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion by glucose in rat pancreatic islets There was a 98% greater augmentation of insulin secretion by 16.7 mM glucose (in the presence of diazoxide and 40 mM K+) in primed islets; however, the ability of high glucose to augment PLC activity bore no relationship to the secretory response MPA markedly inhibited PLC in both conditions; however, insulin secretion was only inhibited (by 46%) in primed islets These data indicate that an adequate level of GTP is critical for glucose's potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion in primed islets but that PLC activation can clearly be dissociated from insulin secretion and therefore cannot be the major cause of glucose's augmentation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion

Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and phospholipase Cgamma1 that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation. However, both EGF and insulin stimulated the accumulation of phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the $T1$-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with $T2$ at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and insulin in response to oxytocin treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of oxytocin influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both insulin and CCK levels were decreased in response to the oxytocin treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that $T1$ induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and $T2$, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of $T1$ on glucose utilization and on the expression of $T2$ may be mediated through central mechanism

Activation of EGFR overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes leads to a 3.4 +/- 1.2-fold stimulation of $T1$ activity over basal levels vs. only 1.06 +/- 0.01-fold stimulation by $T2$. Despite the low levels of insulin-induced PLC activity, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was similarly inhibited by U73122 (55.9 +/- 13.1% inhibition) Inhibition of PLC activation did not impair either EGF- or insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase or incorporation of glucose into lipid, supporting the hypothesis that both EGF- and insulin-induced glucose disposal can be independent of GLUT4-mediated glucose transport. The diminution of glucose transport secondary to inhibition of PLC activity was reflected by a decrease in GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane upon either EGF or insulin stimulation

Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and phospholipase C (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced $T1$-mediated $T2$ secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in PLC-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on PLC-mediated insulin secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Leptin effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and neuropeptide Y [In Process Citation] $T1$ may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of $T2$ (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of $T1$$T2$ (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

Induction by leptin of uncoupling protein-2 and enzymes of fatty acid oxidation Here we show that leptin alters in pancreatic islets the mRNA of the genes encoding enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) $T1$ overexpression increased $T2$ mRNA by more than 10-fold in epididymal, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous fat tissue of normal, but not of leptin-receptor-defective obese rats By directly regulating the expression of enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and of UCP-2, leptin controls intracellular triglyceride content of certain nonadipocytes, as well as adipocytes

Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle $T1$ subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT $T2$ mRNA to 30-40% of control However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and UCPs appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics

We previously reported that adiposity and serum leptin levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum leptin are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic $T1$ mRNA by $T2$ may be impaired with age We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus Leptin infusion diminished hypothalamic NPY levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in senescent rats These diminished responses to leptin were associated with and may be the result of an impaired suppression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels

We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial IP3 was increased within 30 seconds after OT treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that $T1$ stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding $T2$ and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

Both receive information about the nutritional status and the level of energy storage through insulin and leptin signaling mediated by specific receptors located on POMC and NPY neurons present predominantly in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). When leptin signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the $T1$$T2$ signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the NPY system is upregulated as shown by mRNA overexpression and increased peptide release, whereas the content and/or release of some inhibitory peptides (neurotensin, cholecystokinin) are diminished.

Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic Neuropeptide Y Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular $T1$$T2$ (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), $T1$$T2$ and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), leptin (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, UCP-2, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins

We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, $T1$ also causes the translocation of $T2$ from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of $T1$ prevented such a decrease in $T2$ To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of $T1$ The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The $T2$ Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of PKC-alpha, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not PKC-epsilon, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that PKC activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

UCP2, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, $T1$ (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats $T2$ increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic $T1$ Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of $T2$ and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), $T1$$T2$ and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), leptin (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, UCP-2, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins

Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma $T1$, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT $T2$ mRNA to 30-40% of control However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and UCPs appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics

We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, AVP also causes the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by $T1$$T2$ activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and $T1$$T2$ and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), leptin (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, UCP-2, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and insulin in response to oxytocin treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of $T1$ influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), $T2$ and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both insulin and CCK levels were decreased in response to the oxytocin treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that oxytocin induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and insulin, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The $T1$ Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or $T2$ Time-dependent redistribution of PKC-alpha, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not PKC-epsilon, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that PKC activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

Oxytocin-stimulated insulin release in a clonal beta-cell line RINm5F: involvement of phospholipase C-dependent and -independent pathways. CONCLUSION: Oxy increases insulin release through both PLC and non-PLC mediated signal transduction mechanisms.

Insulin-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that $T1$ treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and $T2$, are expressed at sufficient levels.

$T1$ secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and $T2$ (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in PLC-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on PLC-mediated insulin secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for $T1$ and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in $T2$-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of UCPs may be mediated through central mechanism

Insulin-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with $T1$$T2$ has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that insulin treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PLCgamma, are expressed at sufficient levels.

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the $T1$$T2$ (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

Gibbestatin B inhibits the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Insulin-like signaling in yeast: modulation of protein phosphatase 2A, protein kinase A, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activities In addition, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by insulin, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus insulin in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the GPI-PLC $T1$ was most pronouncedly stimulated by authentic human $T2$ compared to various insulin analogues and insulin-like growth factor I As the GPI-PLC reaction is rate limiting, the efficiency of the two-step anchor cleavage was significantly increased when insulin was present together with glucose as compared to glucose alone The insulin concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation The data suggest that mammalian insulin-sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC) involved in the transduction of the insulin signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase

Roles of GTP and phospholipase C in the potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion by glucose in rat pancreatic islets There was a 98% greater augmentation of insulin secretion by 16.7 mM glucose (in the presence of diazoxide and 40 mM K+) in primed islets; however, the ability of high glucose to augment PLC activity bore no relationship to the secretory response MPA markedly inhibited PLC in both conditions; however, $T1$$T2$ activity bore no relationship to the secretory response MPA markedly inhibited PLC in both conditions; however, insulin secretion was only inhibited (by 46%) in primed islets These data indicate that an adequate level of GTP is critical for glucose's potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion in primed islets but that PLC activation can clearly be dissociated from insulin secretion and therefore cannot be the major cause of glucose's augmentation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion

Effect of residual endogenous $T1$ secretion on the abnormal $T2$ response to hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetics Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous insulin secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates OT secretion DESIGN: Case-control study: the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous insulin secretion Blood samples for OT assay were taken just before the rapid injection of insulin (time 0) and at time 15, 30, 45 and 60 min CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a residual endogenous insulin secretion exerts a partial protective action against the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder affecting the OT secretory system in IDDM

$T1$, $T2$ and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic Neuropeptide Y Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that $T1$ rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic $T2$ and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for $T1$$T2$ expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of UCPs may be mediated through central mechanism

UCP2, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that $T1$ increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of $T2$, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

Induction by leptin of uncoupling protein-2 and enzymes of fatty acid oxidation Here we show that leptin alters in pancreatic islets the mRNA of the genes encoding enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) Leptin overexpression increased $T1$$T2$ (UCP-2) Leptin overexpression increased UCP-2 mRNA by more than 10-fold in epididymal, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous fat tissue of normal, but not of leptin-receptor-defective obese rats By directly regulating the expression of enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and of UCP-2, leptin controls intracellular triglyceride content of certain nonadipocytes, as well as adipocytes

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hCG, hCG plus oxytocin and oxytocin on [3H] inositol phosphate (IP) formations in porcine myometrial cells obtained from ovariectomized and cyclic gilts The highest production of total inositol phosphates (d.p.m.) was found in cells from ovariectomized gilts given in vivo estradiol benzoate and progesterone for five consecutive days and treated with 1000 mU hCG and 100 mU hCG plus 1 microM oxytocin (984 +/- 84 and 1063 +/- 131 vs 314 +/- 36, respectively) There was also a very significant increase of $T1$ after the addition of 1000 mU hCG (p < 0.001) and IP1 and IP3 when 1000 mU hCG plus oxytocin were added (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively) Only oxytocin alone increased the formation of IPs in cells from ovariectomized pigs treated with estradiol in vivo (p < 0.01) The highest dose of hCG plus The highest dose of hCG plus oxytocin provoked accumulation of total [3H]$T2$ (p < 0.05) 53% over the basal level on days 21/1 of the estrous cycle The present study demonstrates that hCG and oxytocin can increase the accumulation of inositol phosphates in porcine myometrial cells

Influence of obesity and menopausal status on serum leptin, cholecystokinin, galanin and neuropeptide Y levels Obesity occurs in 60% of women after menopause and is characterized by an excess of adipose tissue that depends on several orexigenic (neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates carbohydrate ingestion, galanin stimulates fat intake) and anorectic (leptin, cholecystokinin (CCK)) factors Both leptin and insulin can reduce hypothalamic $T1$$T2$ (NPY) stimulates carbohydrate ingestion, galanin stimulates fat intake) and anorectic (leptin, cholecystokinin (CCK)) factors Both leptin and insulin can reduce hypothalamic NPY production and secretion We investigated basal levels of serum leptin, CCK, galanin and NPY in 16 non-obese premenopausal women, in 15 obese premenopausal women (body mass index (BMI) 34.6 +/- 1.3 SD) and in ten obese postmenopausal women (BMI 34.7 +/- 1.5 SD) to determine the relationship between obesity, menopause and these neuropeptides Significantly increased leptin and galanin levels in postmenopausal obese women coupled with decreased NPY levels revealed some changes in the neuropeptides regulating eating behavior, which may be the reason for the onset of postmenopausal obesity

The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1), oxytocin, prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) on 45Ca2+ mobilization in permeabilized rat myometrial cells and to examine the activation of the inositol lipid cycle in intact myocytes All four agonists caused a biphasic release of 45Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial pool(s), with the rank order of potency: oxytocin > PGF2 alpha > ET-1 > IP3 Endothelin-1 and oxytocin stimulated $T1$$T2$ Endothelin-1 and oxytocin stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation at concentrations similar to those that promoted 45Ca2+ efflux, whereas about 100 times higher concentrations of PGF2 alpha were needed to activate this signaling pathway in intact cells It is concluded that the primary action of PGF2 alpha in myometrial cells is to enhance Ca2+ influx, whereas oxytocin and ET-1 receptors are coupled to phospholipase C, generating IP3 and raising the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ from intracellular as well as extracellular sources

We have studied the effects of neomycin, a potent inhibitor of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC), on the germination of rice seed and the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in the aleurone layer and the scutellar tissues It was shown that, in the absence of exogenous Ca2+, neomycin markedly reduced the germination speed and seedling growth of rice seeds and inhibited the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in both secretory tissues These results strongly suggest that the phosphoinositide-Ca2+ signal transduction pathway may play an important role in the $T1$-induced expression of $T2$ molecules closely related to the germination processes of rice seed

Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and $T1$$T2$ and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), leptin (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, UCP-2, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins

Overexpression of G11alpha and isoforms of phospholipase C in islet  beta-cells reveals a lack of correlation between inositol phosphate  accumulation and insulin secretion. It has been suggested that insulin secretion from pancreatic islets may be  mediated in part by activation of phospholipases C (PLCs) and  phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The purpose of this study was to determine  whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated $T1$ secretion responses  of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or  activation of $T2$ isoforms. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PLC-delta1, -beta1, or  -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement  in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in insulin  secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite  the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell  extracts. Overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets  elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on  insulin secretion. Because the effect of carbachol on insulin secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PLC-beta1  or -beta3. Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect  slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3, but  these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated insulin  secretion.

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on $T1$ expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in $T2$ To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma $T1$$T2$ (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT UCP-3 mRNA to 30-40% of control However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and UCPs appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics

Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and $T1$ in response to $T2$ treatment The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of oxytocin influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose In addition, both insulin and CCK levels were decreased in response to the oxytocin treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05) When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only In conclusion, these results show that oxytocin induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and insulin, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of $T1$, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not $T2$, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that PKC activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

Effect of residual endogenous insulin secretion on the abnormal oxytocin response to hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetics Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous $T1$ secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates $T2$ secretion DESIGN: Case-control study: the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous insulin secretion Blood samples for OT assay were taken just before the rapid injection of insulin (time 0) and at time 15, 30, 45 and 60 min CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a residual endogenous insulin secretion exerts a partial protective action against the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder affecting the OT secretory system in IDDM

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced $T1$ secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the $T2$ (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and $T1$ (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in $T2$-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on PLC-mediated insulin secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for $T1$, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of $T2$ may be mediated through central mechanism

Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic $T1$ Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular $T2$ administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Signal transduction of arginine vasopressin-induced arachidonic acid release in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts: role of Ca2+ and the protein kinase C-dependent activation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 or ionomycin, mimicked the effect of AVP, whereas the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, TPA, only induced a slight increase in AA release Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells; PKC inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of $T1$$T2$ inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta by long-term (24 h) TPA treatment caused a partial blockade of the AVP-induced response, whereas the A23187-induced AA release was unaffected by down-regulation of these isoforms AVP- or TPA-induced activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK were completely blocked by down-regulation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta, but still occurred, together with the cytosolic PLA2 mobility shift, in the absence of external Ca2+ These results show that AVP-induced AA release in H9c2 cells is secondary to activation of the V1 receptor/Gq protein/PLCP pathway, leading to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and activation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta

UCP2, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that $T1$ increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, $T2$ and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial $T1$ was increased within 30 seconds after $T2$ treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that OT stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding IP3 and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and $T1$ (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced $T2$ secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in PLC-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on PLC-mediated insulin secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with $T1$ causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and $T2$ that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation. However, both EGF and insulin stimulated the accumulation of phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the insulin-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.

In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and uncoupling protein genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the $T1$$T2$ (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the leptin gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking $T1$-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle $T2$ (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

OT may rapidly stimulate inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) formation, consistent with the concept of rapid activation of a second-messenger system In support of this hypothesis, endometrial IP3 levels were increased (P < 0.05) within 0.5 min after treatment with 0.1 microM OT These results indicate that $T1$ induces endometrial $T2$ production in a rapid manner indicative of a second-messenger system

In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and uncoupling protein genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for $T1$$T2$ genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the leptin gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic $T1$ secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of $T2$ distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative $T1$ expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of $T2$ may be mediated through central mechanism

Relationship among leptin, neuropeptide Y, and galanin in young women and in postmenopausal women [see comments] OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormonal status may affect neuropeptide Y (NPY), galanin, and leptin release in postmenopausal women and in young women CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the differences is plasma leptin, $T1$$T2$ release in postmenopausal women and in young women CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the differences is plasma leptin, NPY, and galanin between postmenopausal women and young women may be related to body mass index rather than to differences in hormonal status and that the higher NPY levels in both lean and obese postmenopausal women than in young women indicate that factors other than body mass index may be involved

We propose that $T1$ binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate ($T2$)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial IP3 was increased within 30 seconds after OT treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that OT stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding IP3 and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of $T1$ encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with $T2$ but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of $T1$$T2$ in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed Summing up, new evidence suggests that NPY and leptin may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level

Overexpression of G11alpha and isoforms of $T1$ in islet  beta-cells reveals a lack of correlation between inositol phosphate  accumulation and $T2$ secretion. It has been suggested that insulin secretion from pancreatic islets may be  mediated in part by activation of phospholipases C (PLCs) and  phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The purpose of this study was to determine  whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated insulin secretion responses  of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or  activation of PLC isoforms. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PLC-delta1, -beta1, or  -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement  in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in insulin  secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite  the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell  extracts. Overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets  elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on  insulin secretion. Because the effect of carbachol on insulin secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PLC-beta1  or -beta3. Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect  slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3, but  these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated insulin  secretion.

We have recently shown that $T1$ causes a $T2$ (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, AVP also causes the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

Effect of residual endogenous insulin secretion on the abnormal oxytocin response to hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetics Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous insulin secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates OT secretion DESIGN: Case-control study: the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous insulin secretion Blood samples for OT assay were taken just before the rapid injection of insulin (time 0) and at time 15, 30, 45 and 60 min CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a residual endogenous $T1$ secretion exerts a partial protective action against the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder affecting the $T2$ secretory system in IDDM

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of $T1$ on muscle $T2$ expression

$T1$ effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and $T2$ [In Process Citation] Leptin may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and phospholipase Cgamma1 that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation. However, both EGF and $T1$ stimulated the accumulation of $T2$ at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the insulin-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.

Effects of intravenously infused $T1$ on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of $T2$ in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of UCPs may be mediated through central mechanism

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of $T1$ secretion by information flow in the $T2$/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Leptin effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and neuropeptide Y [In Process Citation] Leptin may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and $T1$$T2$, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng oxytocin caused a significant rise not only of insulin but also of glucagon and glucose levels In contrast, nanogram amounts of $T1$ administered ICV cause a rise of $T2$ levels

NPY-leptin: opposing effects on appetitive and consummatory ingestive behavior and sexual behavior Many studies have indicated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates and leptin inhibits food intake In line with this, intracerebroventricular injection of NPY (10 microg) stimulated and $T1$ (10 microg) inhibited intake of a sucrose solution when female rats were required to obtain the solution from a bottle However, $T2$ inhibited and leptin stimulated intake if the solution was infused intraorally Thus NPY stimulates the responses used to obtain food but inhibits those used to consume food, and leptin has the opposite effects

A loop system exists between hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peripheral adipose tissue leptin to maintain normal body homeostasis When infused i.c.v. to normal rats to mimic its central effects, leptin decreases $T1$ levels, thus food intake and body weight Circadian fluctuations of NPY and leptin levels maintain normal body homeostasis Leptin increases the expression of $T2$ (UCP-1, -2, -3) and thus energy dissipation

Activation of EGFR overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes leads to a 3.4 +/- 1.2-fold stimulation of PLC activity over basal levels vs. only 1.06 +/- 0.01-fold stimulation by insulin. Despite the low levels of $T1$-induced $T2$ activity, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was similarly inhibited by U73122 (55.9 +/- 13.1% inhibition) Inhibition of PLC activation did not impair either EGF- or insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase or incorporation of glucose into lipid, supporting the hypothesis that both EGF- and insulin-induced glucose disposal can be independent of GLUT4-mediated glucose transport. The diminution of glucose transport secondary to inhibition of PLC activity was reflected by a decrease in GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane upon either EGF or insulin stimulation

Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and phospholipase C (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice A specific enhancement in PLC-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action This action of leptin on $T1$-mediated $T2$ secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of $T1$ is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of $T2$ secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Oxytocin-stimulated insulin release in a clonal beta-cell line RINm5F: involvement of phospholipase C-dependent and -independent pathways. CONCLUSION: Oxy increases insulin release through both PLC and non-PLC mediated signal transduction mechanisms.

Aggregated beta amyloid peptide 1-40 decreases Ca2+- and cholinergic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide degradation by alteration of membrane and cytosolic phospholipase C in brain cortex The effects of full-length amyloid beta protein, A(beta) (1-40), on phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) were investigated in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) and cytosol prepared from the cerebral cortex of adult rats Aggregated A(beta) also decreased significantly the level of diacylglycerol, the product of PLC This additionally supports the inhibitory effect of A(beta) on membrane-bound and cytosolic PLC Moreover, A(beta) (1-40) significantly decreased the basal activity of the $T1$$T2$ peptide 1-40 decreases Ca2+- and cholinergic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide degradation by alteration of membrane and cytosolic phospholipase C in brain cortex The effects of full-length amyloid beta protein, A(beta) (1-40), on phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) were investigated in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) and cytosol prepared from the cerebral cortex of adult rats Aggregated A(beta) also decreased significantly the level of diacylglycerol, the product of PLC This additionally supports the inhibitory effect of A(beta) on membrane-bound and cytosolic PLC Moreover, A(beta) (1-40) significantly decreased the basal activity of the PIP2-PLC in SPM and the enzyme activity regulated through cholinergic receptors

Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), $T1$ (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, $T2$, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for $T1$ and 100, 107, and 29 for $T2$ in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of UCPs may be mediated through central mechanism

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of $T1$ in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by $T2$ (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

$T1$-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the $T2$ and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade. Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate that insulin treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PLCgamma, are expressed at sufficient levels.

In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and uncoupling protein genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the $T1$$T2$ genes and the leptin gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways

Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM) The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP Time-dependent redistribution of $T1$, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not PKC-epsilon, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP We conclude that $T2$ activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells

Interleukin-1 beta inhibits phospholipase C and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and insulin secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both $T1$$T2$ and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and insulin secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both PLC as well as Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis

Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen. Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for $T1$$T2$ expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of UCPs may be mediated through central mechanism

Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation] The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA). In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of $T1$-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA $T2$ transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

Overexpression of G11alpha and isoforms of phospholipase C in islet  beta-cells reveals a lack of correlation between inositol phosphate  accumulation and insulin secretion. It has been suggested that $T1$ secretion from pancreatic islets may be  mediated in part by activation of $T2$ (PLCs) and  phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The purpose of this study was to determine  whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated insulin secretion responses  of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or  activation of PLC isoforms. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PLC-delta1, -beta1, or  -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement  in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in insulin  secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite  the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell  extracts. Overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets  elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on  insulin secretion. Because the effect of carbachol on insulin secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PLC-beta1  or -beta3. Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect  slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3, but  these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated insulin  secretion.

C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively. GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts. These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hCG, hCG plus oxytocin and oxytocin on [3H] inositol phosphate (IP) formations in porcine myometrial cells obtained from ovariectomized and cyclic gilts The highest production of total inositol phosphates (d.p.m.) was found in cells from ovariectomized gilts given in vivo estradiol benzoate and progesterone for five consecutive days and treated with 1000 mU hCG and 100 mU hCG plus 1 microM oxytocin (984 +/- 84 and 1063 +/- 131 vs 314 +/- 36, respectively) There was also a very significant increase of $T1$ after the addition of 1000 mU hCG (p < 0.001) and IP1 and IP3 when 1000 mU hCG plus oxytocin were added (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively) Only oxytocin alone increased the formation of $T2$ in cells from ovariectomized pigs treated with estradiol in vivo (p < 0.01) The highest dose of hCG plus The highest dose of hCG plus oxytocin provoked accumulation of total [3H]inositol phosphate (p < 0.05) 53% over the basal level on days 21/1 of the estrous cycle The present study demonstrates that hCG and oxytocin can increase the accumulation of inositol phosphates in porcine myometrial cells

Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and $T1$$T2$ in lipid mobilization The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed Summing up, new evidence suggests that NPY and leptin may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level

$T1$ Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic $T2$ Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51% The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of $T1$ (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the $T2$ to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

UCP2, $T1$ and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, $T2$ (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT
