Cellular preincubation with 200 microg/ml antibodies against the inositolphosphoglycan (IPG) moiety of the GPI-anchor (Ab(IPG)), or depletion in GPI-anchored proteins by cellular pretreatment with 0.5 U/ml PI-$T1$, 1 mM $T2$ and 2 HU/ml streptolysin-O, or depletion in membrane cholesterol content by filipin (5 microg/ml), digitonin (5 microg/ml) and cholesterol oxidase (0.5 U/ml) decreases the HDL3-signal, suggesting the involvement of a lipolytic cleavage of GPI-anchored proteins

However, the $T1$-dependent stimulation required activation of $T2$ (PKC), whereas the inhibition was PKC independent, indicating that the NGF-induced signaling pathways leading to inhibition and stimulation of HCO3- absorption are distinct

Secreted form of $T1$ precursor protein activates protein kinase C and $T2$ in cultured embryonic rat neocortical cells Furthermore, we demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma1 and formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were increased by sAPP695-stimulation

Ten protein kinases have been assayed for their ability to phosphorylate in vitro the recombinant bovine PrP (25-242) (rbPrP) With regard to $T1$$T2$ (25-242) (rbPrP) With regard to CK2, phosphorylation occurs at Ser 154 with a stoichiometry of about 0.1 mol phosphate/mol rbPrP, which is doubled by mild heat treatment of rbPrP

Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of $T1$ secretion by information flow in the $T2$/Protein kinase C pathway The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) have been shown to stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells However, AVP-induced activation of RSK2, a downstream substrate of ERK1 and ERK2, was $T1$$T2$ (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells However, AVP-induced activation of RSK2, a downstream substrate of ERK1 and ERK2, was PKC-dependent and PI 3-kinase-independent PKC was necessary in AVP- but not in LPA-induced activation of p70 S6K

A loop system exists between hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peripheral adipose tissue leptin to maintain normal body homeostasis When infused i.c.v. to normal rats to mimic its central effects, $T1$ decreases $T2$ levels, thus food intake and body weight Circadian fluctuations of NPY and leptin levels maintain normal body homeostasis Leptin increases the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCP-1, -2, -3) and thus energy dissipation

Homogeneous liposome immunoassay for insulin using phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens Insulin was conjugated to phospholipase C by a three-step procedure with hetero-bifunctional crosslinking reagents, succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate and 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester Both p-nitrophenylphosphatidylcholine hydrolytic activity and liposome lytic activity of insulin-$T1$ conjugate were inhibited in the presence of $T2$ antiserum

Relationship among $T1$, $T2$, and galanin in young women and in postmenopausal women [see comments] OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormonal status may affect neuropeptide Y (NPY), galanin, and leptin release in postmenopausal women and in young women CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the differences is plasma leptin, NPY, and galanin between postmenopausal women and young women may be related to body mass index rather than to differences in hormonal status and that the higher NPY levels in both lean and obese postmenopausal women than in young women indicate that factors other than body mass index may be involved
