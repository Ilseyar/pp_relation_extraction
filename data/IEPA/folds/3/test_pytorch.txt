Concurrent decrease of vasopressin and protein kinase Calpha immunoreactivity during the light phase in the vole suprachiasmatic nucleus Mean numbers of AVP- and protein kinase Calpha-immunoreactive neurons were determined in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of common voles, entrained to a 12:12 h light-dark (LD) cycle, at the beginning of the light period (zeitgeber time zero) and 6 h later (zeitgeber time six) At zeitgeber time zero, mean numbers of AVP- and $T1$$T2$- and protein kinase Calpha- immunoreactive neurons were 2194 and 9897, respectively

Oxytocin-stimulated insulin release in a clonal beta-cell line RINm5F: involvement of phospholipase C-dependent and -independent pathways. CONCLUSION: Oxy increases insulin release through both PLC and non-PLC mediated signal transduction mechanisms. In addition, U-73122 diminished the Oxy-induced increase in intracellular concentration of $T1$ (IP3) U-73122 at 8 mumol.L-1 totally abolished the Oxy-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3; however it reduced the Oxy-induced increase in insulin release only by 36% and 63% in the monolayer and suspended cell preparations, respectively Oxytocin-stimulated insulin release in a clonal beta-cell line RINm5F: involvement of phospholipase C-dependent and -independent pathways AIM: To study the mechanisms underlying $T2$ (Oxy)-induced insulin release RESULTS: Oxy increased insulin release and [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner Oxy-induced insulin release was not altered by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PT) U-73122 at 8 mumol.L-1 totally abolished the Oxy-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3; however it reduced the Oxy-induced increase in insulin release only by 36% and 63% in the monolayer and suspended cell preparations, respectively CONCLUSION: Oxy increases insulin release through both PLC and non-PLC mediated signal transduction mechanisms

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hCG, hCG plus oxytocin and oxytocin on [3H] inositol phosphate (IP) formations in porcine myometrial cells obtained from ovariectomized and cyclic gilts The highest production of total inositol phosphates (d.p.m.) was found in cells from ovariectomized gilts given in vivo estradiol benzoate and progesterone for five consecutive days and treated with 1000 mU hCG and 100 mU hCG plus 1 microM oxytocin (984 +/- 84 and 1063 +/- 131 vs 314 +/- 36, respectively) There was also a very significant increase of IP1 after the addition of 1000 mU hCG (p < 0.001) and IP1 and IP3 when 1000 mU hCG plus oxytocin were added (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively) Only oxytocin alone increased the formation of IPs in cells from ovariectomized pigs treated with estradiol in vivo (p < 0.01) The highest dose of hCG plus The highest dose of hCG plus oxytocin provoked accumulation of total [3H]inositol phosphate (p < 0.05) 53% over the basal level on days 21/1 of the estrous cycle The present study demonstrates that hCG and $T1$ can increase the accumulation of $T2$ in porcine myometrial cells
