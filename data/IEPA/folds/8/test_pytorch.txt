Melatonin inhibits oxytocin response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, but not to angiotensin II in normal men In order to establish whether melatonin alters basal and/or stimulated oxytocin secretion, 18 normal men were treated (p.o.) with 6 or 12 mg melatonin or placebo in basal conditions (N-6 subjects) or concomitantly to the administration of insulin (O.15 IU/kg body weight in an i.v. bolus) (N-6 subjects) or angiotensin II (increasing doses of 4, 8 and 16 ng/kg/min, at intervals of 20 min) In contrast, the $T1$ response to $T2$-induced hypoglycemia was significantly reduced by melatonin treatment

Leptin effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and neuropeptide Y [In Process Citation] $T1$ may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of $T2$ (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.

Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2 On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of $T1$$T2$ (also termed 'casein kinase 2') We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2 A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain

$T1$ effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and $T2$ [In Process Citation] Leptin may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M). In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.
