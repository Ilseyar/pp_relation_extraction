Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of $T1$ on muscle $T2$ expression

To explore the possible roles of the hypothalamic melanocortin system in leptin action, we examined the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of leptin with or without SHU9119, a potent antagonist of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, on food intake, body weight, and mitochondrial $T1$$T2$ with or without SHU9119, a potent antagonist of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, on food intake, body weight, and mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) mRNA expression in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in rats A single i.c.v. injection of leptin decreased cumulative food intake and body weight gain, and increased UCP-1 mRNA expression during 3 h at the onset of the dark phase Co-injection of SHU9119 also inhibited completely the leptin-induced increase in UCP-1 mRNA expression in the BAT

Interleukin-1 beta inhibits phospholipase C and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and insulin secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both $T1$$T2$ and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and insulin secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both PLC as well as Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis

We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, $T1$ also causes the translocation of $T2$ from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), leptin (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, $T1$$T2$ and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), leptin (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, UCP-2, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins

Interleukin-1 beta inhibits phospholipase C and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and $T1$$T2$ and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and insulin secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both PLC as well as Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis

UCP2, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats $T1$ increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and $T2$ mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms Subcutaneous injections of $T1$ increased $T2$, glucagon and glucose levels significantly Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng oxytocin caused a significant rise not only of insulin but also of glucagon and glucose levels In contrast, nanogram amounts of oxytocin administered ICV cause a rise of insulin levels

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on $T1$ expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in $T2$ To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression

We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, AVP also causes the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by $T1$$T2$ activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

The effects of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inositol phosphate (IP) generation in human myometrial cells were evaluated and compared to the effects of oxytocin In contrast, the potencies of oxytocin to raise IP and [Ca2+]i were similar and independent of extracellular Ca2+, and could be suppressed by pertussis toxin and phorbol ester, but not by verapamil The action of PGF2 alpha depends on extracellular Ca2+, whereas oxytocin activates the G-protein-dependent phospholipase-C-$T1$$T2$ (IP) generation in human myometrial cells were evaluated and compared to the effects of oxytocin In contrast, the potencies of oxytocin to raise IP and [Ca2+]i were similar and independent of extracellular Ca2+, and could be suppressed by pertussis toxin and phorbol ester, but not by verapamil The action of PGF2 alpha depends on extracellular Ca2+, whereas oxytocin activates the G-protein-dependent phospholipase-C-IP3-Ca2+ signal-transducing pathway, complemented by the influx of extracellular Ca2+

UCP2, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT The present study indicates that $T1$ increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, $T2$ and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT

We have recently shown that $T1$ causes a $T2$ (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells In these cells, AVP also causes the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

Interleukin-1 beta inhibits phospholipase C and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and insulin secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both $T1$$T2$ secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both PLC as well as Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis

To explore the possible roles of the hypothalamic melanocortin system in leptin action, we examined the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of leptin with or without SHU9119, a potent antagonist of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, on food intake, body weight, and mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) mRNA expression in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in rats A single i.c.v. injection of leptin decreased cumulative food intake and body weight gain, and increased UCP-1 mRNA expression during 3 h at the onset of the dark phase Co-injection of SHU9119 also inhibited completely the $T1$-induced increase in $T2$ mRNA expression in the BAT

Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular $T1$ infusion on $T2$ expression in rat muscle A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3 To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression
