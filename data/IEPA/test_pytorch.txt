In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and $T1$ genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues OBJECTIVE : To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor ( AR ) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action , on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins ( ucp1 , ucp2 and ucp3 ) in brown and white adipose tissues CONCLUSION : The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain $T2$ genes and the leptin gene can be achieved , and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways

We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors ( OTR ) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide ( PI ) hydrolysis , thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate ( IP3 ) -diacylglycerol ( DAG ) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion Endometrial $T1$ was increased within 30 seconds after $T2$ treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT These results support the hypothesis that OT stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI , yielding IP3 and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs

Effect of residual endogenous insulin secretion on the abnormal oxytocin response to hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetics Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous insulin secretion , we wondered whether this factor also regulates OT secretion DESIGN : Case-control study : the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous insulin secretion Blood samples for OT assay were taken just before the rapid injection of insulin ( time 0 ) and at time 15 , 30 , 45 and 60 min CONCLUSIONS : These data indicate that a residual endogenous $T1$ secretion exerts a partial protective action against the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder affecting the $T2$ secretory system in IDDM

Our data demonstrate , that activation of mitogen activated protein ( MAP ) kinase alone is sufficient to promote $T1$ secretion , whereas inhibition of MAP kinase will reduce APP secretion only when $T2$ or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are additionally inhibited

Possible central nervous system ( CNS ) mechanisms could mediate these responses in that leptin receptors are located on hypothalamic neurons that coexpress $T1$ ( NPY ) or proopiomelanocortin ( POMC ) and both peptides that have been implicated as mediators of the CNS action of $T2$ .
