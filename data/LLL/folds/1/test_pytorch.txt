Taken together, the results support the idea that sequestration of SpoIIE protein into the prespore plays an important role in the control of sigmaF activation and in coupling this activation to septation. sigmaF is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an anti-sigma factor, SpoIIAB, an anti-anti-sigma factor, $T1$$T2$, an anti-anti-sigma factor, SpoIIAA, and a membrane-bound phosphatase, SpoIIE, which converts the inactive, phosphorylated form of SpoIIAA back to the active form.

The Bacillus subtilis clpC operon is regulated by two stress induction pathways relying on either $T1$ or a class III stress induction mechanism acting at a $T2$-like promoter. Our data demonstrate that the CtsR protein acts as a global repressor of the clpC operon, as well as other class III heat shock genes, by preventing unstressed transcription from either the sigmaB- or sigmaA-dependent promoter and might be inactivated or dissociate under inducing stress conditions.

Most cot genes, and the gerE gene, are transcribed by sigmaK RNA polymerase. Previously, it was shown that the GerE protein inhibits transcription in vitro of the sigK gene encoding sigmaK. These results demonstrate that $T1$-dependent transcription of gerE initiates a negative feedback loop in which GerE acts as a repressor to limit production of $T2$. A low level of GerE activated transcription of cotD by sigmaK RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of GerE repressed cotD transcription. Here, we show that GerE binds near the sigK transcriptional start site, to act as a repressor. We show that GerE binds to two sites that span the -35 region of the cotD promoter. These results suggest that a rising level of GerE in sporulating cells may first activate cotD transcription from the upstream site then repress transcription as the downstream site becomes occupied.

Although spo0H is transcriptionally regulated by the key regulatory device that controls sporulation initiation, the $T1$$T2$ is transcriptionally regulated by the key regulatory device that controls sporulation initiation, the Spo0 phosphorelay, there is considerable evidence implicating a mechanism of post-translational control that governs the activity and concentration of sigmaH.
