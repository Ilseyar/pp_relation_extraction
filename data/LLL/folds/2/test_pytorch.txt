Most cot genes, and the gerE gene, are transcribed by sigmaK RNA polymerase. Previously, it was shown that the GerE protein inhibits transcription in vitro of the sigK gene encoding sigmaK. These results demonstrate that sigmaK-dependent transcription of gerE initiates a negative feedback loop in which GerE acts as a repressor to limit production of sigmaK. A low level of $T1$ activated transcription of cotD by sigmaK RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of GerE repressed $T2$ transcription. Here, we show that GerE binds near the sigK transcriptional start site, to act as a repressor. We show that GerE binds to two sites that span the -35 region of the cotD promoter. These results suggest that a rising level of GerE in sporulating cells may first activate cotD transcription from the upstream site then repress transcription as the downstream site becomes occupied.
