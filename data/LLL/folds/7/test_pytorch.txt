The addition of $T1$ to in vitro transcription reactions resulted in the stimulation of RNAP holoenzyme activity, but $T2$-RNAP was observed to be more sensitive to ClpX-dependent stimulation than sigmaA-RNAP.

DNase I footprinting showed that SpoIIID binds strongly to two sites in the cotC promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the cotX promoter, and does not bind specifically to cotB. Transcription of the cotB, cotC, and cotX genes by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called GerE. In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cot gene expression results from the combined action of GerE and another transcription factor, SpoIIID. A low concentration of GerE activated cotB transcription by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of cotX or cotC. $T1$ at low concentration repressed cotC transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed $T2$ transcription and had little effect on cotB transcription.
