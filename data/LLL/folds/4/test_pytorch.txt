sspG transcription also requires the DNA binding protein $T1$$T2$ transcription also requires the DNA binding protein GerE. In contrast, sspJ is transcribed in the forespore compartment by RNA polymerase with the forespore-specific sigmaG and appears to give a monocistronic transcript.

Our results indicate that the level of KatX level in outgrowing spores depends mainly on EsigmaF, because sigB mutants show normal KatX activity in dormant and outgrowing spores. Therefore, the physiological role of sigmaB-dependent katX expression remains obscure. The -10 and -35 sequences of the sigmaB- and $T1$$T2$- and sigmaF-dependent promoters of katX overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide. We demonstrated that katX is also a sigmaB-dependent general stress gene, since it is strongly induced by heat, salt and ethanol stress, as well as by energy depletion.

The rocG gene of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, is transcribed by $T1$$T2$ gene of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, is transcribed by SigL-containing RNA polymerase and requires for its expression RocR, a member of the NtrC/NifA family of proteins that bind to enhancer-like elements, called upstream activating sequences (UAS). Unlike the case for other sigma(54)-dependent genes, rocG has no UAS; instead, its expression depends on a sequence located 1.5 kilobases downstream of the rocG promoter, beyond the end of the rocG coding region.
