Production of sigmaK about 1 h earlier than normal does affect Spo0A, which when phosphorylated is an activator of sigE transcription. The ald promoter, like the sigE promoter, is believed to be recognized by $T1$$T2$ promoter, is believed to be recognized by sigmaA RNA polymerase, suggesting that sigmaK may inhibit sigmaA activity late in sporulation. In the mother cell compartment of sporulating cells, expression of the sigE gene, encoding the earlier-acting sigma factor, sigmaE, is negatively regulated by the later-acting sigma factor, sigmaK.

The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of SpoIIE, depends on the cell division protein FtsZ and could correspond to the FtsZ-dependent assembly of SpoIIE into E-rings. Evidence based on the use of modified and mutant forms of the phosphatase protein indicates that $T1$ blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated $T2$ to activate sigmaF until formation of the polar septum is completed. Cell-specific activation of transcription factor sigmaF during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis requires the formation of the polar septum and the activity of a serine phosphatase (SpoIIE) located in the septum. The SpoIIE phosphatase indirectly activates sigmaF by dephosphorylating a protein (SpoIIAA-P) in the pathway that controls the activity of the transcription factor.

From these results we conclude that ComK negatively regulates degR expression by preventing sigmaD-driven transcription of $T1$$T2$ expression by preventing sigmaD-driven transcription of degR, possibly through interaction with the control region.
