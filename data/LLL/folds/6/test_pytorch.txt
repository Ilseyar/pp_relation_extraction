DNase I footprinting showed that SpoIIID binds strongly to two sites in the cotC promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the $T1$ promoter, and does not bind specifically to $T2$. Transcription of the cotB, cotC, and cotX genes by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called GerE. In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cot gene expression results from the combined action of GerE and another transcription factor, SpoIIID. A low concentration of GerE activated cotB transcription by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of cotX or cotC. SpoIIID at low concentration repressed cotC transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed cotX transcription and had little effect on cotB transcription.

The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of SpoIIE, depends on the cell division protein $T1$$T2$, depends on the cell division protein FtsZ and could correspond to the FtsZ-dependent assembly of SpoIIE into E-rings. Evidence based on the use of modified and mutant forms of the phosphatase protein indicates that SpoIIE blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated SpoIIAA to activate sigmaF until formation of the polar septum is completed. Cell-specific activation of transcription factor sigmaF during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis requires the formation of the polar septum and the activity of a serine phosphatase (SpoIIE) located in the septum. The SpoIIE phosphatase indirectly activates sigmaF by dephosphorylating a protein (SpoIIAA-P) in the pathway that controls the activity of the transcription factor.
