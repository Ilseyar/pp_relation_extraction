Although spo0H is transcriptionally regulated by the key regulatory device that controls sporulation initiation, the $T1$$T2$ is transcriptionally regulated by the key regulatory device that controls sporulation initiation, the Spo0 phosphorelay, there is considerable evidence implicating a mechanism of post-translational control that governs the activity and concentration of sigmaH.

The sigmaB-dependent promoter drives expression of yvyD under stress conditions and after glucose starvation, whereas a $T1$-dependent promoter is responsible for $T2$ transcription following amino acid limitation. This indicates that the yvyD gene product, being a member of both the sigmaB and sigmaH regulons, might negatively regulate the activity of the sigmaL regulon. In addition to the typical sigmaB-dependent, stress- and starvation-inducible pattern, yvyD is also induced in response to amino acid depletion.

Most cot genes, and the gerE gene, are transcribed by sigmaK RNA polymerase. Previously, it was shown that the GerE protein inhibits transcription in vitro of the sigK gene encoding sigmaK. These results demonstrate that sigmaK-dependent transcription of gerE initiates a negative feedback loop in which GerE acts as a repressor to limit production of sigmaK. A low level of GerE activated transcription of cotD by sigmaK RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of $T1$$T2$ by sigmaK RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of GerE repressed cotD transcription. Here, we show that GerE binds near the sigK transcriptional start site, to act as a repressor. We show that GerE binds to two sites that span the -35 region of the cotD promoter. These results suggest that a rising level of GerE in sporulating cells may first activate cotD transcription from the upstream site then repress transcription as the downstream site becomes occupied.

Transcription of the cotB, cotC, and cotX genes by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called GerE. In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cot gene expression results from the combined action of GerE and another transcription factor, SpoIIID. A low concentration of GerE activated cotB transcription by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of cotX or cotC. SpoIIID at low concentration repressed cotC transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed cotX transcription and had little effect on $T1$$T2$ transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed cotX transcription and had little effect on cotB transcription.

The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of SpoIIE, depends on the cell division protein FtsZ and could correspond to the FtsZ-dependent assembly of SpoIIE into E-rings. Evidence based on the use of modified and mutant forms of the phosphatase protein indicates that SpoIIE blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated SpoIIAA to activate $T1$$T2$ blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated SpoIIAA to activate sigmaF until formation of the polar septum is completed. Cell-specific activation of transcription factor sigmaF during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis requires the formation of the polar septum and the activity of a serine phosphatase (SpoIIE) located in the septum. The SpoIIE phosphatase indirectly activates sigmaF by dephosphorylating a protein (SpoIIAA-P) in the pathway that controls the activity of the transcription factor.

DNase I footprinting showed that SpoIIID binds strongly to two sites in the cotC promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the cotX promoter, and does not bind specifically to cotB. Transcription of the cotB, cotC, and cotX genes by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called GerE. In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cot gene expression results from the combined action of GerE and another transcription factor, SpoIIID. A low concentration of GerE activated cotB transcription by final $T1$ RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of cotX or $T2$. SpoIIID at low concentration repressed cotC transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed cotX transcription and had little effect on cotB transcription.

The sigmaB-dependent promoter drives expression of yvyD under stress conditions and after glucose starvation, whereas a sigmaH-dependent promoter is responsible for $T1$$T2$ under stress conditions and after glucose starvation, whereas a sigmaH-dependent promoter is responsible for yvyD transcription following amino acid limitation. This indicates that the yvyD gene product, being a member of both the sigmaB and sigmaH regulons, might negatively regulate the activity of the sigmaL regulon. In addition to the typical sigmaB-dependent, stress- and starvation-inducible pattern, yvyD is also induced in response to amino acid depletion.

Most cot genes, and the gerE gene, are transcribed by sigmaK RNA polymerase. Previously, it was shown that the GerE protein inhibits transcription in vitro of the sigK gene encoding sigmaK. These results demonstrate that sigmaK-dependent transcription of gerE initiates a negative feedback loop in which $T1$ acts as a repressor to limit production of $T2$. A low level of GerE activated transcription of cotD by sigmaK RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of GerE repressed cotD transcription. Here, we show that GerE binds near the sigK transcriptional start site, to act as a repressor. We show that GerE binds to two sites that span the -35 region of the cotD promoter. These results suggest that a rising level of GerE in sporulating cells may first activate cotD transcription from the upstream site then repress transcription as the downstream site becomes occupied.

Production of sigmaK about 1 h earlier than normal does affect Spo0A, which when phosphorylated is an activator of sigE transcription. The ald promoter, like the sigE promoter, is believed to be recognized by sigmaA RNA polymerase, suggesting that sigmaK may inhibit sigmaA activity late in sporulation. In the mother cell compartment of sporulating cells, expression of the sigE gene, encoding the earlier-acting sigma factor, sigmaE, is negatively regulated by the later-acting sigma factor, $T1$$T2$ gene, encoding the earlier-acting sigma factor, sigmaE, is negatively regulated by the later-acting sigma factor, sigmaK.

Taken together, the results support the idea that sequestration of $T1$ protein into the prespore plays an important role in the control of $T2$ activation and in coupling this activation to septation. sigmaF is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving an anti-sigma factor, SpoIIAB, an anti-anti-sigma factor, SpoIIAA, and a membrane-bound phosphatase, SpoIIE, which converts the inactive, phosphorylated form of SpoIIAA back to the active form.

The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of SpoIIE, depends on the cell division protein FtsZ and could correspond to the FtsZ-dependent assembly of SpoIIE into E-rings. Evidence based on the use of modified and mutant forms of the phosphatase protein indicates that SpoIIE blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated SpoIIAA to activate sigmaF until formation of the polar septum is completed. Cell-specific activation of transcription factor sigmaF during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis requires the formation of the polar septum and the activity of a serine phosphatase (SpoIIE) located in the septum. The SpoIIE phosphatase indirectly activates sigmaF by dephosphorylating a protein ($T1$$T2$ by dephosphorylating a protein (SpoIIAA-P) in the pathway that controls the activity of the transcription factor.

The rocG gene of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, is transcribed by SigL-containing RNA polymerase and requires for its expression RocR, a member of the NtrC/NifA family of proteins that bind to enhancer-like elements, called upstream activating sequences (UAS). Unlike the case for other $T1$-dependent genes, $T2$ has no UAS; instead, its expression depends on a sequence located 1.5 kilobases downstream of the rocG promoter, beyond the end of the rocG coding region.

Our results indicate that the level of KatX level in outgrowing spores depends mainly on $T1$$T2$ level in outgrowing spores depends mainly on EsigmaF, because sigB mutants show normal KatX activity in dormant and outgrowing spores. Therefore, the physiological role of sigmaB-dependent katX expression remains obscure. The -10 and -35 sequences of the sigmaB- and sigmaF-dependent promoters of katX overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide. We demonstrated that katX is also a sigmaB-dependent general stress gene, since it is strongly induced by heat, salt and ethanol stress, as well as by energy depletion.

DNase I footprinting showed that SpoIIID binds strongly to two sites in the cotC promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the cotX promoter, and does not bind specifically to cotB. Transcription of the cotB, cotC, and cotX genes by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called $T1$$T2$, cotC, and cotX genes by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called GerE. In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cot gene expression results from the combined action of GerE and another transcription factor, SpoIIID. A low concentration of GerE activated cotB transcription by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of cotX or cotC. SpoIIID at low concentration repressed cotC transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed cotX transcription and had little effect on cotB transcription.

Most cot genes, and the $T1$$T2$ genes, and the gerE gene, are transcribed by sigmaK RNA polymerase. Previously, it was shown that the GerE protein inhibits transcription in vitro of the sigK gene encoding sigmaK. These results demonstrate that sigmaK-dependent transcription of gerE initiates a negative feedback loop in which GerE acts as a repressor to limit production of sigmaK. A low level of GerE activated transcription of cotD by sigmaK RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of GerE repressed cotD transcription. Here, we show that GerE binds near the sigK transcriptional start site, to act as a repressor. We show that GerE binds to two sites that span the -35 region of the cotD promoter. These results suggest that a rising level of GerE in sporulating cells may first activate cotD transcription from the upstream site then repress transcription as the downstream site becomes occupied.

Our results indicate that the level of KatX level in outgrowing spores depends mainly on EsigmaF, because sigB mutants show normal KatX activity in dormant and outgrowing spores. Therefore, the physiological role of sigmaB-dependent katX expression remains obscure. The -10 and -35 sequences of the sigmaB- and $T1$$T2$- and sigmaF-dependent promoters of katX overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide. We demonstrated that katX is also a sigmaB-dependent general stress gene, since it is strongly induced by heat, salt and ethanol stress, as well as by energy depletion.

The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of SpoIIE, depends on the cell division protein FtsZ and could correspond to the FtsZ-dependent assembly of SpoIIE into E-rings. Evidence based on the use of modified and mutant forms of the phosphatase protein indicates that SpoIIE blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated SpoIIAA to activate sigmaF until formation of the polar septum is completed. Cell-specific activation of transcription factor sigmaF during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis requires the formation of the polar septum and the activity of a serine phosphatase (SpoIIE) located in the septum. The $T1$ phosphatase indirectly activates sigmaF by dephosphorylating a protein ($T2$) in the pathway that controls the activity of the transcription factor.

A low level of GerE activated transcription of cotD by $T1$ RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of $T2$ repressed cotD transcription. Here, we show that GerE binds near the sigK transcriptional start site, to act as a repressor. We show that GerE binds to two sites that span the -35 region of the cotD promoter.

Production of sigmaK about 1 h earlier than normal does affect Spo0A, which when phosphorylated is an activator of sigE transcription. The ald promoter, like the $T1$ promoter, is believed to be recognized by sigmaA RNA polymerase, suggesting that sigmaK may inhibit $T2$ activity late in sporulation. In the mother cell compartment of sporulating cells, expression of the sigE gene, encoding the earlier-acting sigma factor, sigmaE, is negatively regulated by the later-acting sigma factor, sigmaK.

Our results indicate that the level of KatX level in outgrowing spores depends mainly on EsigmaF, because sigB mutants show normal KatX activity in dormant and outgrowing spores. Therefore, the physiological role of $T1$-dependent $T2$ expression remains obscure. The -10 and -35 sequences of the sigmaB- and sigmaF-dependent promoters of katX overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide. We demonstrated that katX is also a sigmaB-dependent general stress gene, since it is strongly induced by heat, salt and ethanol stress, as well as by energy depletion.

DNase I footprinting showed that SpoIIID binds strongly to two sites in the $T1$ promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the cotX promoter, and does not bind specifically to $T2$. Transcription of the cotB, cotC, and cotX genes by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called GerE. In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cot gene expression results from the combined action of GerE and another transcription factor, SpoIIID. A low concentration of GerE activated cotB transcription by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of cotX or cotC. SpoIIID at low concentration repressed cotC transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed cotX transcription and had little effect on cotB transcription.

Most cot genes, and the gerE gene, are transcribed by sigmaK RNA polymerase. Previously, it was shown that the GerE protein inhibits transcription in vitro of the sigK gene encoding sigmaK. These results demonstrate that $T1$-dependent transcription of gerE initiates a negative feedback loop in which GerE acts as a repressor to limit production of $T2$. A low level of GerE activated transcription of cotD by sigmaK RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of GerE repressed cotD transcription. Here, we show that GerE binds near the sigK transcriptional start site, to act as a repressor. We show that GerE binds to two sites that span the -35 region of the cotD promoter. These results suggest that a rising level of GerE in sporulating cells may first activate cotD transcription from the upstream site then repress transcription as the downstream site becomes occupied.

The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of SpoIIE, depends on the cell division protein FtsZ and could correspond to the $T1$-dependent assembly of $T2$ into E-rings. Evidence based on the use of modified and mutant forms of the phosphatase protein indicates that SpoIIE blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated SpoIIAA to activate sigmaF until formation of the polar septum is completed. Cell-specific activation of transcription factor sigmaF during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis requires the formation of the polar septum and the activity of a serine phosphatase (SpoIIE) located in the septum. The SpoIIE phosphatase indirectly activates sigmaF by dephosphorylating a protein (SpoIIAA-P) in the pathway that controls the activity of the transcription factor.

From these results we conclude that ComK negatively regulates degR expression by preventing sigmaD-driven transcription of degR, possibly through interaction with the control region. We have shown previously that the transcription of degR is driven by an alternative sigma factor, $T1$$T2$ is driven by an alternative sigma factor, sigmaD.

The Bacillus subtilis clpC operon is regulated by two stress induction pathways relying on either $T1$ or a class III stress induction mechanism acting at a $T2$-like promoter. Our data demonstrate that the CtsR protein acts as a global repressor of the clpC operon, as well as other class III heat shock genes, by preventing unstressed transcription from either the sigmaB- or sigmaA-dependent promoter and might be inactivated or dissociate under inducing stress conditions.

DNase I footprinting showed that SpoIIID binds strongly to two sites in the cotC promoter region, binds weakly to one site in the cotX promoter, and does not bind specifically to cotB. Transcription of the cotB, cotC, and cotX genes by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called GerE. In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cot gene expression results from the combined action of GerE and another transcription factor, SpoIIID. A low concentration of GerE activated cotB transcription by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription of cotX or cotC. SpoIIID at low concentration repressed cotC transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed cotX transcription and had little effect on $T1$$T2$ transcription and had little effect on cotB transcription.

Our results indicate that the level of KatX level in outgrowing spores depends mainly on EsigmaF, because sigB mutants show normal KatX activity in dormant and outgrowing spores. Therefore, the physiological role of sigmaB-dependent katX expression remains obscure. The -10 and -35 sequences of the $T1$- and sigmaF-dependent promoters of $T2$ overlap, and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide. We demonstrated that katX is also a sigmaB-dependent general stress gene, since it is strongly induced by heat, salt and ethanol stress, as well as by energy depletion.

Most cot genes, and the gerE gene, are transcribed by sigmaK RNA polymerase. Previously, it was shown that the GerE protein inhibits transcription in vitro of the sigK gene encoding sigmaK. These results demonstrate that sigmaK-dependent transcription of gerE initiates a negative feedback loop in which GerE acts as a repressor to limit production of sigmaK. A low level of $T1$ activated transcription of cotD by sigmaK RNA polymerase in vitro, but a higher level of $T2$ repressed cotD transcription. Here, we show that GerE binds near the sigK transcriptional start site, to act as a repressor. We show that GerE binds to two sites that span the -35 region of the cotD promoter. These results suggest that a rising level of GerE in sporulating cells may first activate cotD transcription from the upstream site then repress transcription as the downstream site becomes occupied.
