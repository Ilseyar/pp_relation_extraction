The sigmaB-dependent promoter drives expression of $T1$ under stress conditions and after glucose starvation, whereas a $T2$-dependent promoter is responsible for yvyD transcription following amino acid limitation. This indicates that the yvyD gene product, being a member of both the sigmaB and sigmaH regulons, might negatively regulate the activity of the sigmaL regulon. In addition to the typical sigmaB-dependent, stress- and starvation-inducible pattern, yvyD is also induced in response to amino acid depletion.
