Glutathione S-transferase pull-down performed with Tax deletion mutants and peptide competition have localized the site in Tax critical for binding $T1$/$T2$ to a highly protease-sensitive region around amino acid residues 81 to 95 ( 81QRTSKTLKVLTPPIT95 ) which lies between the domains previously proposed to be important for CREB binding and Tax subunit dimerization .

To characterize the AAV functions mediating this effect , cloned AAV type 2 wild-type or mutant genomes were transfected into simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) -transformed hamster cells together with the six HSV replication genes ( encoding UL5 , UL8 , $T1$ , $T2$ , UL42 , and UL52 ) which together are necessary and sufficient for the induction of SV40 DNA amplification ( R. Heilbronn and H. zur Hausen , J. Virol .

We report here that tropomyosin , which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core , can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores , and can cause the dissociation of up to 30 % of the $T1$ and fimbrin from the cores but does not affect actin binding by 110-kD $T2$ .

However , a number of mammalian DNA repair proteins lack NLS clusters ; these proteins include ERCC1 , ERCC2 ( $T1$ ) , mouse RAD51 , and the $T2$/p58 and HHR23A subunits of XPC .

The domains in $T1$ that are involved in CREB binding and transcriptional activation are highly related to the adenoviral E1A-associated cellular protein p300 ( refs 2 , 3 ) , and to two hypothetical proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans , $T2$ and K03H1.10 ( refs 4 and 5 , respectively ) , whose functions are unknown .
