Using ITP (a substrate for myosin II ATPase) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for myosin II heavy-chain kinase [MHCK]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of myosin heavy chains occurred at the foci within the entity1_term network, a result that suggests that entity2_term was localized at the foci.

To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound entity1_term, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit entity2_term.

The higher affinity of vaccinia profilin for polyphosphoinositides (Kd = 0.2-8.5 microM) than for entity1_term or poly(L-proline) and the concentration of vaccinia entity2_term expressed in infected HeLa cells (approximately 20 microM) suggest that vaccinia profilin binds preferentially to PIP and PIP2 in vivo.
