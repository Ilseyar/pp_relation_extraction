The $T1$ dimer , which is crucial for $T2$ and lipid binding , is built of a backbone containing the 200 kDa rod portions , at both ends of which a 47 kDa globular domain is attached .

Hence , we conclude that in its dimeric form , which is used in $T1$ and lipid binding , $T2$ is a dumbbell-shaped molecule built of two antiparallel subunits .
