CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the cooperative modulation of the actin cytoskeleton by $T1$$T2$ cytoskeleton by cofilin and Aip1. Immunofluorescence staining of a wild-type strain using anti-Aip1 antibodies revealed that Aip1 was distributed in cortical actin patches where cofilin was also co-localized.

Characterization of the interactions of alpha-catenin with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/plakoglobin. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/$T1$$T2$; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a $T1$$T2$ homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that $T1$$T2$ filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

The binding constants of Acanthamoeba profilin to fluorescein-labeled actin from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added $T1$$T2$ from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added profilin concentration. These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled actin is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include profilin.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to $T1$$T2$ to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Effects of single amino acid substitutions in the actin-binding site on the biological activity of bovine profilin I. However, these mutants displayed a lower affinity for actin than wild-type profilin, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase profilin's affinity for $T1$$T2$ than wild-type profilin, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase profilin's affinity for actin. These results emphasize the highly conserved biological function of profilins with low sequence homology, and correlate specifically their actin-binding capacity with cell motility and proliferation.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from $T1$$T2$ correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells.

The binding constants of Acanthamoeba $T1$ to fluorescein-labeled $T2$ from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added profilin concentration. These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled actin is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include profilin.

Effects of single amino acid substitutions in the actin-binding site on the biological activity of bovine profilin I. However, these mutants displayed a lower affinity for actin than wild-type profilin, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase $T1$$T2$, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase profilin's affinity for actin. These results emphasize the highly conserved biological function of profilins with low sequence homology, and correlate specifically their actin-binding capacity with cell motility and proliferation.

The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

The binding constants of Acanthamoeba profilin to fluorescein-labeled actin from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the $T1$$T2$ to fluorescein-labeled actin from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added profilin concentration. These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled actin is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include profilin.

These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled actin is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include profilin.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the $T1$ interaction is not the sole determinant of $T2$ protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

Effects of single amino acid substitutions in the actin-binding site on the biological activity of bovine profilin I. However, these mutants displayed a lower affinity for actin than wild-type profilin, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase $T1$$T2$ than wild-type profilin, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase profilin's affinity for actin. These results emphasize the highly conserved biological function of profilins with low sequence homology, and correlate specifically their actin-binding capacity with cell motility and proliferation.

The NH2-terminal 16kD of Abp1p, a 65-kD yeast protein identified by its ability to bind to actin filaments, is 23% identical to yeast cofilin. We have biochemically identified the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of the mammalian actin binding protein cofilin.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the $T1$ variants with $T2$ correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

Characterization of the interactions of alpha-catenin with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/plakoglobin. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. $T1$ or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the $T2$/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric $T1$$T2$ to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the $T1$$T2$ function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that $T1$ binds to $T2$ filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

Immunofluorescence experiments showed that, like $T1$, $T2$ is associated with the membrane actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we demonstrate using viscosity, sedimentation, and actin assembly rate assays that yeast cofilin (16 kD) possesses all of these properties. The NH2-terminal 16kD of Abp1p, a 65-kD yeast protein identified by its ability to bind to actin filaments, is 23% identical to yeast cofilin. We have biochemically identified the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of the mammalian actin binding protein cofilin.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that $T1$$T2$ monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

The binding constants of Acanthamoeba profilin to fluorescein-labeled actin from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added profilin concentration. These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled $T1$ is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include $T2$.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace $T1$$T2$ correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

Although co-localization of glucokinase with actin filaments was not clearly demonstrated in the pancreatic beta-cell line MIN6, islet glucokinase was found to be present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, though predominantly in the nucleus. A portion of glucokinase appeared to be co-localized with actin filaments in the cytoplasm of cultured rat hepatocytes incubated with 25 mM glucose.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to $T1$ filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of $T2$ to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/$T1$$T2$, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.

Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant $T1$ mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/$T2$/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric $T1$$T2$ binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Characterization of the interactions of alpha-catenin with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/plakoglobin. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or $T1$ is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to $T2$/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.
