As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, $T1$ and $T2$ colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Biochemical complementation experiments also indicate that the PRP9 and PRP11 proteins interact. Four yeast spliceosomal proteins (PRP5, PRP9, PRP11, and PRP21) interact to promote $T1$$T2$, and PRP21) interact to promote U2 snRNP binding to pre-mRNA.

Characterization of the interactions of $T1$ with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/$T2$. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

How profilin/barbed-end synergy controls actin polymerization: a kinetic model of the ATP hydrolysis circuit. In particular, both profilin and free filament barbed ends have been shown to play major roles in the processing of ATP by $T1$$T2$ and free filament barbed ends have been shown to play major roles in the processing of ATP by actin. We have developed a new integrated kinetic model to examine how the maintenance of the pool of unpolymerized actin and the flux of actin subunits through filaments are controlled by profilin and free filament barbed ends through their interaction with ATP.

Characterization of the interactions of alpha-catenin with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/plakoglobin. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/$T1$ complex to the $T2$ cytoskeleton.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, $T1$$T2$ of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and $T1$, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with $T2$, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

In order to clarify cofilin-dependent regulation of actin assembly in muscle cells, cofilin tagged with fluorescence dyes was introduced into C2 myoblasts by a micro injection method. The exogeneous cofilin, but not ADF, caused quick disassembly of actin filaments and accumulated in furrow region of dividing cells. These results suggest that the subcellular distribution of cofilin as well as its interaction with $T1$$T2$ as well as its interaction with actin in vivo is regulated by its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

Characterization of the interactions of alpha-catenin with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/plakoglobin. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the $T1$/catenin complex to the $T2$ cytoskeleton.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while $T1$$T2$ rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

In order to clarify cofilin-dependent regulation of actin assembly in muscle cells, cofilin tagged with fluorescence dyes was introduced into C2 myoblasts by a micro injection method. The exogeneous cofilin, but not $T1$, caused quick disassembly of $T2$ filaments and accumulated in furrow region of dividing cells.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear $T1$$T2$ colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while $T1$$T2$ colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but $T1$$T2$ colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Our findings strongly suggest that in brain profilin I and profilin II complexes link the actin cytoskeleton and endocytic membrane flow, directing $T1$ and $T2$ assembly to distinct membrane domains.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while $T1$$T2$ and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, $T1$ and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but $T2$ appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.
