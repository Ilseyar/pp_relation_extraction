Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of $T1$, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to $T2$ and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

In contrast, overexpression of the profilin gene, PFY1, encoding an actin-binding protein, leads to no very obvious phenotype. Interestingly, profilin overproduction can compensate for the deleterious effects of too much actin in a profilin concentration-dependent manner.

$T1$$T2$2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

In this model, profilin can bind both to actin monomers with a Kd of about 5 microM and to the barbed end of actin filaments with a Kd of about 50-100 microM. Quantitative analysis of the effect of Acanthamoeba profilin on actin filament nucleation and elongation. The current view of the mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin is that it binds to actin monomers, forming a complex that cannot polymerize [Tobacman, L. S., & Korn, E. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4166-4170; Tseng, P., & Pollard, T. D. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 94, 213-218; Tobacman, L. S., Brenner, S. L., & Korn, E. D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8806-8812]. This model includes two different Kd's--one for profilin bound to actin monomers and one for $T1$ bound to an $T2$ molecule at the barbed end of a filament.

Kinetic measurements indicate that $T1$ binding to $T2$ weakens the affinity of actin for nucleotides primarily due to an increased nucleotide dissociation rate constant, but the nucleotide association rate constant is also increased about 2-fold. The data suggest that profilin binding to actin weakens nucleotide binding to actin by disrupting Mg(2+) coordination in the actin central cleft.

A series of truncations was carried out at the C terminus of profilin, a region that has been implicated in actin binding. Since our earlier studies of Acanthamoeba profilins suggested the importance of PIP2 binding for suppression, we conclude that both activities are implicated and that an interplay between PIP2 binding and actin binding may be important for $T1$$T2$ binding may be important for profilin function.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for $T1$$T2$2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for $T1$$T2$ for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of $T1$$T2$ bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

These results suggest that LIMK2 functions downstream of the Rho-ROCK signalling pathway and plays a role in reorganization of $T1$$T2$-ROCK signalling pathway and plays a role in reorganization of actin filaments and membrane structures, by phosphorylating cofilin/ADF proteins. We report here that LIMK1 and LIMK2 phosphorylate both cofilin and actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) specifically at Ser-3 and exhibit partially distinct substrate specificity when tested using site-directed cofilin mutants as substrates.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or $T1$$T2$ because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the $T1$ subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of $T2$.

This model includes two different Kd's--one for profilin bound to $T1$ monomers and one for profilin bound to an $T2$ molecule at the barbed end of a filament.

Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, $T1$ competed with the binding of $T2$ to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

In this model, profilin can bind both to actin monomers with a Kd of about 5 microM and to the barbed end of actin filaments with a Kd of about 50-100 microM. Quantitative analysis of the effect of Acanthamoeba profilin on actin filament nucleation and elongation. The current view of the mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin is that it binds to $T1$$T2$ is that it binds to actin monomers, forming a complex that cannot polymerize [Tobacman, L. S., & Korn, E. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4166-4170; Tseng, P., & Pollard, T. D. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 94, 213-218; Tobacman, L. S., Brenner, S. L., & Korn, E. D. (1983) J. Biol.

High levels of profilin suppress the lethality caused by overproduction of actin in yeast cells. In contrast, overexpression of the profilin gene, $T1$$T2$ gene, PFY1, encoding an actin-binding protein, leads to no very obvious phenotype.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, $T1$$T2$, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as $T1$$T2$ and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the $T1$-binding site of $T2$.

In this model, profilin can bind both to actin monomers with a Kd of about 5 microM and to the barbed end of actin filaments with a Kd of about 50-100 microM. Quantitative analysis of the effect of Acanthamoeba profilin on actin filament nucleation and elongation. The current view of the mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin is that it binds to actin monomers, forming a complex that cannot polymerize [Tobacman, L. S., & Korn, E. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4166-4170; Tseng, P., & Pollard, T. D. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 94, 213-218; Tobacman, L. S., Brenner, S. L., & Korn, E. D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8806-8812].

High levels of profilin suppress the lethality caused by overproduction of actin in yeast cells. In contrast, overexpression of the profilin gene, PFY1, encoding an actin-binding protein, leads to no very obvious phenotype. Interestingly, profilin overproduction can compensate for the deleterious effects of too much $T1$ in a $T2$ concentration-dependent manner.

Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, $T1$$T2$ bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of $T1$ for barbed ends of $T2$ filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to $T1$$T2$ and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

$T1$/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links $T2$ filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as $T1$ or $T2$ do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.
