Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for $T1$$T2$ expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Here, we prepared a profilin mutant (H119E) defective in actin binding, but retaining the ability to bind to other proteins. The essential role of profilin in the assembly of actin for microspike formation. These findings provide the first evidence that profilin is a key molecule linking a signaling network to rapid actin polymerization in microspike formation. This mutant profilin I suppresses actin polymerization in microspike formation induced by $T1$$T2$ polymerization in microspike formation induced by N-WASP, the essential factor in microspike formation.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, $T1$ and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, $T2$, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

However, once initiated, the synthesis of muscle tropomyosin mRNA continued in the presence of cycloheximide, while the expression of $T1$$T2$ mRNA continued in the presence of cycloheximide, while the expression of muscle actin, myosin heavy chain, and myogenin mRNA was abolished. These results suggest that muscle-specific processing of tropomyosin transcripts can continue to occur in the absence of myogenin expression unlike the expression of muscle actin and myosin heavy chain mRNAs.

These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or $T1$$T2$, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

CONCLUSIONS: The expression of $T1$, $T2$, and gamma-catenin is related to histological type and differentiation in NSCLC, although catenins have no independent prognostic value. Reduced expression of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin is associated with high cell proliferative activity and poor differentiation in non-small cell lung cancer.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, $T1$, CD44v6, $T2$, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

CONCLUSIONS: The expression of $T1$, beta-catenin, and $T2$ is related to histological type and differentiation in NSCLC, although catenins have no independent prognostic value. Reduced expression of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin is associated with high cell proliferative activity and poor differentiation in non-small cell lung cancer.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect $T1$$T2$ or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

Here, we prepared a profilin mutant (H119E) defective in actin binding, but retaining the ability to bind to other proteins. The essential role of profilin in the assembly of $T1$$T2$ in the assembly of actin for microspike formation. These findings provide the first evidence that profilin is a key molecule linking a signaling network to rapid actin polymerization in microspike formation. This mutant profilin I suppresses actin polymerization in microspike formation induced by N-WASP, the essential factor in microspike formation.

$T1$ such as $T2$ and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

CONCLUSIONS: The expression of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and $T1$$T2$, and gamma-catenin is related to histological type and differentiation in NSCLC, although catenins have no independent prognostic value. Reduced expression of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin is associated with high cell proliferative activity and poor differentiation in non-small cell lung cancer.

The observed in vivo expression patterns of alpha-catenin, $T1$$T2$, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin suggest that these proteins are directly linked with the developmental regulation of cell junctions, as cardiac cells become stably committed and phenotypically differentiated to eventually form a mature myocardium. This study details the expression patterns of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin, during definition of the cardiac cell population as distinct compartments in the anterior regions of the chick embryo between stages 5 and 9.

The observed in vivo expression patterns of alpha-catenin, $T1$, and $T2$ suggest that these proteins are directly linked with the developmental regulation of cell junctions, as cardiac cells become stably committed and phenotypically differentiated to eventually form a mature myocardium. This study details the expression patterns of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin, during definition of the cardiac cell population as distinct compartments in the anterior regions of the chick embryo between stages 5 and 9.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, $T1$$T2$ expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, $T1$$T2$ (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and $T1$$T2$ such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, $T1$$T2$, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

The findings suggest that M1 $T1$ are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via $T2$ MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, $T1$, and $T2$ expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that vinculin has a negligible influence on internal $T1$ filament dynamics and actin bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with talin, another $T2$ and vinculin-binding protein from focal adhesions.

ActA appears to control at least four functions that collectively lead to actin-based motility: (1) initiation of $T1$ polymerization, (2) polarization of $T2$ function, (3) transformation of actin polymerization into a motile force and (4) acceleration of movement mediated by the host protein profilin.

Absence of alpha-syntrophin leads to structurally aberrant neuromuscular synapses deficient in $T1$$T2$ leads to structurally aberrant neuromuscular synapses deficient in utrophin. Thus, alpha-syntrophin has an important role in synapse formation and in the organization of utrophin, acetylcholine receptor, and acetylcholinesterase at the neuromuscular synapse.
