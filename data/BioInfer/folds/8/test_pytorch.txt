Birch pollen profilin and actin can be copurified as a complex, and purified recombinant birch profilin can be used as an affinity matrix to obtain birch pollen actin. In this study, profilin is identified as an actin-binding protein in higher plants which is present in monocot and dicot angiosperms. The binding of 125I-labeled recombinant birch pollen profilin to plant and animal actins can be blocked by profilin-specific antibodies that react with different epitopes of birch $T1$$T2$ can be blocked by profilin-specific antibodies that react with different epitopes of birch profilin.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for $T1$ function, the role of $T2$ is not yet fully understood.

The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and $T1$$T2$-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Birch $T1$ and actin can be copurified as a complex, and purified recombinant birch $T2$ can be used as an affinity matrix to obtain birch pollen actin. In this study, profilin is identified as an actin-binding protein in higher plants which is present in monocot and dicot angiosperms. The binding of 125I-labeled recombinant birch pollen profilin to plant and animal actins can be blocked by profilin-specific antibodies that react with different epitopes of birch profilin.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and $T1$ is mediated by $T2$, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The frequency-dependent effects of iodotubercidin (ITU, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase), draflazine (a nucleoside transport blocker), and PD81,723 (an allosteric enhancer of the A1 adenosine receptor binding) on the stimulus-to-His bundle (SH) interval, a measure of AV nodal conduction, were determined in guinea pig hearts and compared with those of adenosine and diltiazem. The AV nodal effects of draflazine, ITU, EHNA, and PD81,723 were reversed by the A1 adenosine receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline and adenosine deaminase, implicating endogenous adenosine acting at the $T1$$T2$, implicating endogenous adenosine acting at the A1 adenosine receptor.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type $T1$ precipitated $T2$ from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that $T1$ may modulate the catalytic activities of $T2$ protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

The higher affinity of vaccinia $T1$ for polyphosphoinositides (Kd = 0.2-8.5 microM) than for actin or poly(L-proline) and the concentration of vaccinia profilin expressed in infected HeLa cells (approximately 20 microM) suggest that vaccinia $T2$ binds preferentially to PIP and PIP2 in vivo. We expressed in Escherichia coli the vaccinia virus gene for a protein similar to vertebrate profilins, purified the recombinant viral profilin, and characterized its interactions with actin and polyphosphoinositides.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and $T1$$T2$ protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While $T1$ has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of $T2$ is not yet fully understood.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and $T1$ proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with $T2$ and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between $T1$ and alpha-catenin is mediated by $T2$, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and $T1$$T2$ and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in $T1$$T2$, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in $T1$$T2$ in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for $T1$$T2$ has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Using a complementary sequence or antipeptide to selectively neutralize the stretch of residues 633-642 of $T1$, we recently demonstrated that this segment is an $T2$ binding site operating in the absence as in the presence of nucleotide and that this stretch 633-642 is not part of the nucleotide binding site [Chaussepied & Morales (1988) Proc.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human $T1$$T2$-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The frequency-dependent effects of iodotubercidin (ITU, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase), draflazine (a nucleoside transport blocker), and PD81,723 (an allosteric enhancer of the $T1$$T2$), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase), draflazine (a nucleoside transport blocker), and PD81,723 (an allosteric enhancer of the A1 adenosine receptor binding) on the stimulus-to-His bundle (SH) interval, a measure of AV nodal conduction, were determined in guinea pig hearts and compared with those of adenosine and diltiazem. The AV nodal effects of draflazine, ITU, EHNA, and PD81,723 were reversed by the A1 adenosine receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline and adenosine deaminase, implicating endogenous adenosine acting at the A1 adenosine receptor.
