A binary complex of birch profilin and skeletal muscle actin could be isolated by gel chromatography. Birch profilin increased the critical concentration required for muscle and brain actin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner, supporting the notion of the formation of a heterologous complex between the plant protein and animal actin. Interaction of plant profilin with mammalian actin. In viscometric assays, the birch protein was seen to modulate $T1$ filament formation analogous to animal $T2$. These data indicate that the actin-binding domains in plant and animal profilins are functionally highly conserved, although the overall sequence similarity is less than 25%.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, $T1$$T2$ was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of $T1$ that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled $T2$ (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric $T1$$T2$ isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of $T1$ for monomeric $T2$, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from A:Tbeta4. Recombinant plant (birch) $T1$ was analyzed for its ability to promote $T2$ polymerization from the actin:thymosin beta4 and beta9 complex. These data indicated a negative co-operativity between the profilin and DNase I binding sites on actin.

Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and $T1$$T2$, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

A binary complex of birch profilin and skeletal muscle actin could be isolated by gel chromatography. Birch profilin increased the critical concentration required for muscle and brain actin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner, supporting the notion of the formation of a heterologous complex between the plant protein and animal actin. Interaction of plant $T1$ with mammalian $T2$. In viscometric assays, the birch protein was seen to modulate actin filament formation analogous to animal profilin. These data indicate that the actin-binding domains in plant and animal profilins are functionally highly conserved, although the overall sequence similarity is less than 25%.

Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary binding site in $T1$ which mediates its interaction with beta-catenin and $T2$. It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds either beta-catenin or plakoglobin, which both can assemble alpha-catenin into the complex. Recently we have identified an alpha-catenin binding site in beta-catenin and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on $T1$-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen $T2$ isoform, ZmPRO1.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of $T1$ that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and $T2$-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of $T1$ that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit $T2$.

A binary complex of birch profilin and skeletal muscle actin could be isolated by gel chromatography. Birch profilin increased the critical concentration required for muscle and $T1$$T2$ increased the critical concentration required for muscle and brain actin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner, supporting the notion of the formation of a heterologous complex between the plant protein and animal actin. Interaction of plant profilin with mammalian actin. In viscometric assays, the birch protein was seen to modulate actin filament formation analogous to animal profilin. These data indicate that the actin-binding domains in plant and animal profilins are functionally highly conserved, although the overall sequence similarity is less than 25%.

Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

Depending on the nature of the divalent cation, recombinant plant (birch) profilin exhibited two different modes of interaction with actin, like mammalian profilin. In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from A:Tbeta4. Recombinant plant (birch) profilin was analyzed for its ability to promote actin polymerization from the actin:$T1$$T2$:thymosin beta4 and beta9 complex.

Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary binding site in alpha-catenin which mediates its interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds either beta-catenin or plakoglobin, which both can assemble alpha-catenin into the complex. Recently we have identified an $T1$ binding site in $T2$ and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on $T1$$T2$ isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

A binary complex of birch profilin and skeletal muscle actin could be isolated by gel chromatography. Birch $T1$ increased the critical concentration required for muscle and brain actin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner, supporting the notion of the formation of a heterologous complex between the plant protein and animal $T2$. Interaction of plant profilin with mammalian actin. In viscometric assays, the birch protein was seen to modulate actin filament formation analogous to animal profilin. These data indicate that the actin-binding domains in plant and animal profilins are functionally highly conserved, although the overall sequence similarity is less than 25%.

However, upon treatment with DMSO, cytoplasmic $T1$ filaments were disrupted and intranuclear rod structures containing cofilin and $T2$ were apparently larger and thicker in cells overexpressing cofilin than in normal cells. In cultured cells, cofilin, as well as ADF, translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus together with actin and forms rod-like structures in response to heat shock or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) treatment. Stimulus-dependent disorganization of actin filaments induced by overexpression of cofilin in C2 myoblasts.

A binary complex of birch profilin and skeletal muscle actin could be isolated by gel chromatography. Birch $T1$ increased the critical concentration required for $T2$ and brain actin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner, supporting the notion of the formation of a heterologous complex between the plant protein and animal actin. Interaction of plant profilin with mammalian actin. In viscometric assays, the birch protein was seen to modulate actin filament formation analogous to animal profilin. These data indicate that the actin-binding domains in plant and animal profilins are functionally highly conserved, although the overall sequence similarity is less than 25%.

In this study, we demonstrate that $T1$ isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of $T2$ cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound $T1$, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled $T2$ (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

Recently we have identified an alpha-catenin binding site in beta-catenin and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism.

Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When $T1$ was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen $T2$ isoform, ZmPRO1.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of $T1$ that bound $T2$, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of $T1$$T2$ isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of $T1$ with a high affinity for $T2$ revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

Depending on the nature of the divalent cation, recombinant plant (birch) profilin exhibited two different modes of interaction with actin, like mammalian profilin. In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from A:Tbeta4. Recombinant plant (birch) profilin was analyzed for its ability to promote actin polymerization from the actin:$T1$$T2$ polymerization from the actin:thymosin beta4 and beta9 complex. These data indicated a negative co-operativity between the profilin and DNase I binding sites on actin.
