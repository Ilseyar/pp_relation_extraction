The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) $T1$ functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) $T2$ inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than $T1$$T2$ filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Acanthamoeba actin and profilin can be cross-linked between glutamic acid 364 of $T1$ and lysine 115 of $T2$. Acanthamoeba profilin was cross-linked to actin via a zero-length isopeptide bond using carbodiimide. Since the NH2 terminus of profilin is blocked, Edman degradation gave only the sequence of the conjugated actin CNBr fragment beginning with Trp-356.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: $T1$ has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of $T2$ much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

The affinity of yeast $T1$ for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human $T2$ for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Pyrenyliodoacetamide labeling of cysteine 374 of muscle actin reduces the affinity for profilin 10-fold. Replacement of serine 38 with cysteine created a unique site where labeling with rhodamine did not alter the affinity of profilin for $T1$$T2$ for actin. Three methods, fluorescence anisotropy of rhodamine-labeled profilin, intrinsic fluorescence and nucleotide exchange, give the same affinity, Kd = 0.1 microM, for Acanthamoeba profilins binding amoeba actin monomers with bound Mg-ATP.

Other than monomeric $T1$, no major $T2$ ligands are detected in crude extracts. Our results show that the major pool of polymerizable actin monomers is complexed with profilin and spread throughout the cytoplasm. Selective monoclonal antibodies confirm that most of the profilin is bound to actin: 65% in extract immunoadsorption assays and 74-89% by fluorescent antibody staining. We used biochemical fractionation, immunoassays and microscopy of live and fixed Acanthamoeba to determine how much profilin is bound to its known ligands: actin, membrane PIP(2), Arp2/3 complex and polyproline sequences.

Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with $T1$$T2$ filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit $T1$$T2$ and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

In vivo importance of actin nucleotide exchange catalyzed by profilin. act1-157, an actin mutant with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, suppressed defects in actin organization, cell growth, and fluid-phase endocytosis of pfy1-4, a profilin mutant defective in actin binding. The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of $T1$$T2$ monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of $T1$$T2$ filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Effects of single amino acid substitutions in the actin-binding site on the biological activity of bovine profilin I. However, these mutants displayed a lower affinity for actin than wild-type profilin, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase profilin's affinity for actin. These results emphasize the highly conserved biological function of $T1$ with low sequence homology, and correlate specifically their $T2$-binding capacity with cell motility and proliferation.

Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed profilin I to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric actin also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent DNase. The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) $T1$ regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) $T2$ inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

Other than monomeric actin, no major profilin ligands are detected in crude extracts. Our results show that the major pool of polymerizable actin monomers is complexed with profilin and spread throughout the cytoplasm. Selective monoclonal antibodies confirm that most of the profilin is bound to actin: 65% in extract immunoadsorption assays and 74-89% by fluorescent antibody staining. We used biochemical fractionation, immunoassays and microscopy of live and fixed Acanthamoeba to determine how much $T1$ is bound to its known ligands: $T2$, membrane PIP(2), Arp2/3 complex and polyproline sequences.

Acanthamoeba $T1$ and $T2$ can be cross-linked between glutamic acid 364 of actin and lysine 115 of profilin. Acanthamoeba profilin was cross-linked to actin via a zero-length isopeptide bond using carbodiimide. Since the NH2 terminus of profilin is blocked, Edman degradation gave only the sequence of the conjugated actin CNBr fragment beginning with Trp-356.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast $T1$$T2$ and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with $T1$$T2$ much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

In vivo importance of actin nucleotide exchange catalyzed by profilin. act1-157, an actin mutant with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, suppressed defects in actin organization, cell growth, and fluid-phase endocytosis of pfy1-4, a profilin mutant defective in actin binding. The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study $T1$ function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene ($T2$) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast $T1$$T2$ yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly.

On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with $T1$$T2$ with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet $T1$$T2$ with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than $T1$$T2$ much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

In vivo importance of actin nucleotide exchange catalyzed by profilin. act1-157, an actin mutant with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, suppressed defects in actin organization, cell growth, and fluid-phase endocytosis of pfy1-4, a profilin mutant defective in actin binding. The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae $T1$ gene ($T2$) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

Effects of single amino acid substitutions in the actin-binding site on the biological activity of bovine profilin I. However, these mutants displayed a lower affinity for $T1$ than wild-type $T2$, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase profilin's affinity for actin. These results emphasize the highly conserved biological function of profilins with low sequence homology, and correlate specifically their actin-binding capacity with cell motility and proliferation.

The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit $T1$ with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast $T2$ and pyrene-labeled yeast actin.

Other than monomeric actin, no major profilin ligands are detected in crude extracts. Our results show that the major pool of polymerizable actin monomers is complexed with profilin and spread throughout the cytoplasm. Selective monoclonal antibodies confirm that most of the $T1$ is bound to $T2$: 65% in extract immunoadsorption assays and 74-89% by fluorescent antibody staining. We used biochemical fractionation, immunoassays and microscopy of live and fixed Acanthamoeba to determine how much profilin is bound to its known ligands: actin, membrane PIP(2), Arp2/3 complex and polyproline sequences.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; $T1$ inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with $T2$ cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

In vivo importance of actin nucleotide exchange catalyzed by profilin. act1-157, an actin mutant with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, suppressed defects in actin organization, cell growth, and fluid-phase endocytosis of pfy1-4, a profilin mutant defective in actin binding. The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and $T1$$T2$ gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit $T1$ (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two $T2$. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of $T1$$T2$ much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Acanthamoeba profilin was cross-linked to actin via a zero-length isopeptide bond using carbodiimide.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human $T1$ for rabbit $T2$ (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; $T1$ inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than $T2$; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed profilin I to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric actin also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent DNase. The differential localization of the three $T1$ monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) $T2$ functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) actobindin inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed profilin I to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric actin also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent DNase. The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an $T1$ monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) $T2$ inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit $T1$ (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two $T2$. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: $T1$ has different effects on elongation at the two ends of $T2$ filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit $T1$$T2$ with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; $T1$$T2$ has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
