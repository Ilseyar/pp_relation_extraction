Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, $T1$, and $T2$ were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and $T1$$T2$ mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal regions of talin disrupt actin stress fibers when microinjected into human fibroblasts. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule. To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional $T1$$T2$ disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and actin binding.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in $T1$$T2$ in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The $T1$ profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of $T2$ polymerization.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of $T1$$T2$ promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble $T1$, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and $T2$ were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the $T1$$T2$ polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that $T1$$T2$ raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of $T1$$T2$ relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and $T1$$T2$ and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of $T1$ (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-$T2$ complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

Class II profilins had higher affinity for poly-l-proline and sequestered more monomeric actin than did $T1$$T2$ than did class I profilins.

We propose a model in which profilin alters cellular concentrations of actin polymers in response to fluctuations in cytosolic calcium concentration.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow.

We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and $T1$$T2$ and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Although the chemical basis of these results is not known, they indicate that profilin can tightly sequester actin monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for actin may be under metabolic control.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by $T1$.

We investigate allelic losses in microsatellites of the RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, $T1$$T2$, RAD52, RAD54, BRCA1 and BRCA2 regions, and their correlations with nine pathologic parameters in 127 breast carcinomas.

The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, $T1$ $T2$ in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).

Reversible binding of $T1$ to $T2$ and profilin in human platelet extracts. Sepharose beads coupled to either monoclonal anti-gelsolin antibodies or to polyproline were used to extract gelsolin and profilin, respectively, from EGTA-containing platelet extracts and determine the proportion of these molecules bound to actin with sufficient affinity to withstand dilution (high-affinity complexes). Thrombin, within seconds, caused quantitative conversion of platelet profilin and gelsolin to high-affinity complexes with actin, but these complexes were not present 5 min after stimulation.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or $T1$$T2$ and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of $T1$$T2$ is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Here we show that the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system is involved in the regulation of beta-catenin turnover. beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin, $T1$(cas) or $T2$, becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.

Coexpression of the A8R and A23R genes in Escherichia coli was required for in vitro activity. Expression of the $T1$ and $T2$ genes occurred between 1 and 5 h after vaccinia virus infection and was not prevented by an inhibitor of DNA replication, consistent with a role for VITF-3 in specifically regulating intermediate transcription in vivo. We found that the 34- and 45-kDa polypeptides encoded by vaccinia virus ORFs A8R and A23R, respectively, were necessary to reconstitute transcription of a template with an intermediate stage promoter.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which $T1$ stimulation recruits $T2$ to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with $T1$$T2$. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and $T1$$T2$ and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble $T1$$T2$ to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Recent evidence that profilin inhibits phospholipase C and enhances nucleotide exchange of actin has led some to question whether profilin is ever truly an actin monomer sequestering agent.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of $T1$ relative to free barbed ends and characterized the $T2$ dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in $T1$-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the $T2$ dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the $T1$$T2$, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of $T1$ (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive $T2$ assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

Thrombin, within seconds, caused quantitative conversion of platelet profilin and gelsolin to high-affinity complexes with actin, but these complexes were not present 5 min after stimulation.

Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either $T1$ and $T2$ or MSH2 and MSH3.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal regions of talin disrupt actin stress fibers when microinjected into human fibroblasts. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule. To investigate the possibility that $T1$ disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and $T2$ binding.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous $T1$$T2$ also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Further deletion analysis demonstrated that this fragment contains three regions, which are important for nucleation and share functional and/or limited sequence similarity with host WASP family proteins: an acidic stretch, an actin monomer-binding region, and a cofilin homology sequence. The cofilin homology sequence is critical for stimulating actin nucleation with the $T1$$T2$ nucleation with the Arp2/3 complex in vitro, and is essential for actin polymerization and motility in cells.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor $T1$$T2$ also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal $T1$ binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and $T2$ binding.

$T1$ is generally thought to regulate $T2$ polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in $T1$-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of $T2$ relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Coexpression of the A8R and A23R genes in Escherichia coli was required for in vitro activity. Expression of the A8R and A23R genes occurred between 1 and 5 h after vaccinia virus infection and was not prevented by an inhibitor of DNA replication, consistent with a role for $T1$$T2$ and A23R genes occurred between 1 and 5 h after vaccinia virus infection and was not prevented by an inhibitor of DNA replication, consistent with a role for VITF-3 in specifically regulating intermediate transcription in vivo.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of $T1$-$T2$ complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, $T1$$T2$ and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal regions of talin disrupt actin stress fibers when microinjected into human fibroblasts. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule. To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional $T1$ fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and $T2$ binding.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein $T1$ binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with $T2$ being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Here we show that the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system is involved in the regulation of beta-catenin turnover. beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin, $T1$(cas) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of $T2$.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and $T1$$T2$ in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The $T1$ $T2$ binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of $T1$$T2$ polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical $T1$ patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and $T2$ mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or $T1$$T2$, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. $T1$ localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and $T2$ mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of $T1$ promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of $T2$-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate $T1$ polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of $T2$ and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of $T1$, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and $T2$.

Further deletion analysis demonstrated that this fragment contains three regions, which are important for nucleation and share functional and/or limited sequence similarity with host WASP family proteins: an acidic stretch, an actin monomer-binding region, and a cofilin homology sequence. The cofilin homology sequence is critical for stimulating actin nucleation with the Arp2/3 complex in vitro, and is essential for $T1$$T2$ nucleation with the Arp2/3 complex in vitro, and is essential for actin polymerization and motility in cells.

Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and $T1$ rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the $T2$ rad54 and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.

To determine the phenotypes of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in such lesions, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissues from two patients with PPH, using two antimuscle actin antibodies, $T1$ and CGA7, and two anti-SMC myosin heavy chain markers, anti-$T2$ and anti-SM2 antibodies and related antibodies.

Here we show that the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system is involved in the regulation of beta-catenin turnover. $T1$, but not E-cadherin, p120(cas) or $T2$, becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and $T1$$T2$ in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical $T1$$T2$ localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble $T1$, $T2$, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, $T1$ simply sequesters globular $T2$.
