Role of cofilin in $T1$$T2$ in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of $T1$$T2$ in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

In mouse brain profilin I and profilin II associate with regulators of the endocytic pathway and actin assembly.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human $T1$ protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and $T2$ is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of $T1$ released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized $T2$ associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical $T1$$T2$ localization to cortical actin patches.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; $T1$ inhibits the elongation of $T2$ much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and $T1$ is mediated by $T2$, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and $T1$$T2$ and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that $T1$ is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts $T2$ localization to cortical actin patches.

These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and $T1$$T2$ and PIP kinases and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.

Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a 130-kDa transmembrane receptor for semaphorins, mediators of neuronal guidance, and for vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF(165)), an angiogenesis factor. A 2.2-kb truncated NRP1 cDNA was cloned that encodes a 644-aa $T1$ ($T2$) isoform containing just the a/CUB and b/coagulation factor homology extracellular domains of NRP1. sNRP1 is secreted by cells as a 90-kDa protein that binds VEGF(165), but not VEGF(121).

Although $T1$ released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of $T2$ released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

These data strongly suggest that the head, neck, and tail domains of all myosin heavy chains, and light chains at least of class II myosins, have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated actin-dependent MgATPase activity of Dictyostelium $T1$$T2$, and light chains at least of class II myosins, have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated actin-dependent MgATPase activity of Dictyostelium myosin II requires isoform specific interactions between the heavy chain head and tail and light chains.

Analysis of the formation of the calf spleen complex in the presence of varying concentrations of divalent cations gave evidence for the presence of a high-affinity divalent-cation-binding site on the spleen actin (beta, gamma) which appears to regulate the interaction with profilin. The interaction between calf spleen profilin and actin depends critically on the status of the C-terminus of the actin, and in the case of $T1$$T2$, and in the case of profilin, the C-terminus is of great importance for the physiochemical behaviour of the protein.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of $T1$ in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this $T2$ may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and $T1$$T2$ required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Further deletion analysis demonstrated that this fragment contains three regions, which are important for nucleation and share functional and/or limited sequence similarity with host WASP family proteins: an acidic stretch, an actin monomer-binding region, and a cofilin homology sequence. The cofilin homology sequence is critical for stimulating actin nucleation with the $T1$2/3 complex in vitro, and is essential for $T2$ polymerization and motility in cells.

The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

Effects of single amino acid substitutions in the actin-binding site on the biological activity of bovine profilin I. However, these mutants displayed a lower affinity for actin than wild-type profilin, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase profilin's affinity for $T1$$T2$'s affinity for actin. These results emphasize the highly conserved biological function of profilins with low sequence homology, and correlate specifically their actin-binding capacity with cell motility and proliferation.

Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary binding site in alpha-catenin which mediates its interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds either beta-catenin or plakoglobin, which both can assemble alpha-catenin into the complex. Recently we have identified an alpha-catenin binding site in beta-catenin and $T1$$T2$ and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and $T1$$T2$ and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of $T1$$T2$-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

A binary complex of birch profilin and skeletal muscle actin could be isolated by gel chromatography. Birch profilin increased the critical concentration required for muscle and brain actin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner, supporting the notion of the formation of a heterologous complex between the plant protein and animal actin. Interaction of plant profilin with mammalian actin. In viscometric assays, the birch protein was seen to modulate actin filament formation analogous to animal profilin. These data indicate that the actin-binding domains in plant and animal $T1$$T2$-binding domains in plant and animal profilins are functionally highly conserved, although the overall sequence similarity is less than 25%.

High levels of profilin suppress the lethality caused by overproduction of actin in yeast cells. In contrast, overexpression of the profilin gene, $T1$$T2$ gene, PFY1, encoding an actin-binding protein, leads to no very obvious phenotype.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit $T1$ with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast $T2$ and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive $T1$ assembly off of the pool of actin-$T2$ complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total $T1$ and $T2$ concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the $T1$ variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace $T2$ from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

In vivo importance of actin nucleotide exchange catalyzed by profilin. act1-157, an actin mutant with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, suppressed defects in actin organization, cell growth, and fluid-phase endocytosis of pfy1-4, a profilin mutant defective in actin binding. The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and $T1$$T2$ gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of $T1$$T2$ bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of $T1$ and restricts $T2$ localization to cortical actin patches.

We observed that four replication proteins, UL5, UL8 UL52, and UL9, are necessary for the localization of ICP8 ($T1$$T2$, are necessary for the localization of ICP8 (UL29) to prereplicative sites natural infection conditions.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the $T1$$T2$ cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for $T1$$T2$2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

Birch pollen profilin and actin can be copurified as a complex, and purified recombinant birch profilin can be used as an affinity matrix to obtain birch pollen actin. In this study, $T1$ is identified as an $T2$ in higher plants which is present in monocot and dicot angiosperms. The binding of 125I-labeled recombinant birch pollen profilin to plant and animal actins can be blocked by profilin-specific antibodies that react with different epitopes of birch profilin.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble $T1$$T2$ to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or $T1$$T2$-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast $T1$ and $T2$ proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion.

To investigate the role of cofilin in $T1$$T2$ in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin. Thus, $T1$ forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-$T2$ complexes.

Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed profilin I to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric actin also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent DNase. The differential localization of the three $T1$ monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) $T2$ regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) actobindin inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the $T1$$T2$ shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of $T1$$T2$ being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of $T1$, $T2$, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to $T1$$T2$ to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Although $T1$ released $T2$ at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

In this study, we demonstrate that $T1$ isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of $T2$ cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

Coexpression of the A8R and A23R genes in Escherichia coli was required for in vitro activity. Expression of the $T1$ and $T2$ genes occurred between 1 and 5 h after vaccinia virus infection and was not prevented by an inhibitor of DNA replication, consistent with a role for VITF-3 in specifically regulating intermediate transcription in vivo. We found that the 34- and 45-kDa polypeptides encoded by vaccinia virus ORFs A8R and A23R, respectively, were necessary to reconstitute transcription of a template with an intermediate stage promoter.

Reversible binding of actin to gelsolin and profilin in human platelet extracts. Sepharose beads coupled to either monoclonal anti-gelsolin antibodies or to polyproline were used to extract gelsolin and profilin, respectively, from EGTA-containing platelet extracts and determine the proportion of these molecules bound to actin with sufficient affinity to withstand dilution (high-affinity complexes). Thrombin, within seconds, caused quantitative conversion of platelet profilin and gelsolin to high-affinity complexes with $T1$$T2$ and gelsolin to high-affinity complexes with actin, but these complexes were not present 5 min after stimulation.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to $T1$$T2$ bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Actin-binding proteins such as $T1$ and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric $T2$. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

A truncated $T1$ disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and $T2$: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Compared with control and contralateral kidneys, the ligated kidneys displayed a dynamic expression of mRNAs for many apoptosis-related molecules, which included an up to threefold increase for Fas, Fas ligand, TNF-R1, TRAIL, TRADD, RIP, and caspase-8, and an up to twofold increase for $T1$ and FAP, but there was little change for $T2$. To detect the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, ribonuclease protection assay was used with specific antisense RNA probes for Fas, Fas ligand, TNFR-1, TRAIL, FADD, TRADD, RIP, FAF, FAP, and caspase-8.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and $T1$$T2$-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Although co-localization of glucokinase with $T1$$T2$ with actin filaments was not clearly demonstrated in the pancreatic beta-cell line MIN6, islet glucokinase was found to be present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, though predominantly in the nucleus. A portion of glucokinase appeared to be co-localized with actin filaments in the cytoplasm of cultured rat hepatocytes incubated with 25 mM glucose.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and $T1$, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and $T2$, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Coexpression of the A8R and $T1$$T2$ and A23R genes in Escherichia coli was required for in vitro activity. Expression of the A8R and A23R genes occurred between 1 and 5 h after vaccinia virus infection and was not prevented by an inhibitor of DNA replication, consistent with a role for VITF-3 in specifically regulating intermediate transcription in vivo. We found that the 34- and 45-kDa polypeptides encoded by vaccinia virus ORFs A8R and A23R, respectively, were necessary to reconstitute transcription of a template with an intermediate stage promoter.

The APC binding site on $T1$ may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of $T2$ will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin. Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-catenin complexes.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. $T1$ localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and $T2$ mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

The junctional multidomain protein AF-6 is a binding partner of the Rap1A GTPase and associates with the actin cytoskeletal regulator profilin. To our knowledge, $T1$ is the only integral component in cell-cell junctions discovered thus far that interacts with profilin and thus could modulate $T2$ modeling proximal to adhesion complexes.

The binding constants of Acanthamoeba profilin to fluorescein-labeled actin from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the $T1$$T2$ to fluorescein-labeled actin from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added profilin concentration. These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled actin is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include profilin.

In vivo importance of actin nucleotide exchange catalyzed by profilin. $T1$, an actin mutant with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, suppressed defects in $T2$ organization, cell growth, and fluid-phase endocytosis of pfy1-4, a profilin mutant defective in actin binding. The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, $T1$, $T2$, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

The mechanism of profilin-promoted actin polymerization has been systematically reinvestigated. When measured in the absence of profilin, actin assembly curves over a 0.7-4 microM thymosin-beta4 concentration range fit a simple monomer sequestering model (1 microM K(D) for $T1$.$T2$). With solutions of actin (2 microM) and thymosin-beta4 (2 or 4 microM), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing profilin concentration (0.7-2 microM).

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in $T1$-stimulated $T2$ polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of $T1$ (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-$T2$ complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined.

Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of $T1$ that bound $T2$, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

Acanthamoeba actin and profilin can be cross-linked between glutamic acid 364 of actin and lysine 115 of $T1$$T2$ can be cross-linked between glutamic acid 364 of actin and lysine 115 of profilin. Acanthamoeba profilin was cross-linked to actin via a zero-length isopeptide bond using carbodiimide. Since the NH2 terminus of profilin is blocked, Edman degradation gave only the sequence of the conjugated actin CNBr fragment beginning with Trp-356.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous $T1$$T2$ also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while $T1$$T2$ colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Analysis of the formation of the calf spleen complex in the presence of varying concentrations of divalent cations gave evidence for the presence of a high-affinity divalent-cation-binding site on the $T1$$T2$ (beta, gamma) which appears to regulate the interaction with profilin. The interaction between calf spleen profilin and actin depends critically on the status of the C-terminus of the actin, and in the case of profilin, the C-terminus is of great importance for the physiochemical behaviour of the protein.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of $T1$$T2$ and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human $T1$ protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between $T2$ and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and $T1$$T2$-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on $T1$-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen $T2$ isoform, ZmPRO1.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with $T1$$T2$ may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; $T1$ inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of $T2$ with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the $T1$ variants with $T2$ correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes $T1$$T2$ promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or $T1$$T2$ but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Coexpression of the A8R and A23R genes in Escherichia coli was required for in vitro activity. Expression of the A8R and A23R genes occurred between 1 and 5 h after vaccinia virus infection and was not prevented by an inhibitor of DNA replication, consistent with a role for VITF-3 in specifically regulating intermediate transcription in vivo. We found that the 34- and 45-kDa polypeptides encoded by vaccinia virus ORFs $T1$ and $T2$, respectively, were necessary to reconstitute transcription of a template with an intermediate stage promoter.

Depending on the nature of the divalent cation, recombinant plant (birch) profilin exhibited two different modes of interaction with $T1$, like mammalian $T2$. In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from A:Tbeta4.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and $T1$$T2$ and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in $T1$-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of $T2$ filaments.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of $T1$, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to $T2$ and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical $T1$ patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific $T2$ and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the $T1$$T2$ function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

Depending on the nature of the divalent cation, recombinant plant (birch) profilin exhibited two different modes of interaction with actin, like mammalian profilin. In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from $T1$:$T2$. Recombinant plant (birch) profilin was analyzed for its ability to promote actin polymerization from the actin:thymosin beta4 and beta9 complex. These data indicated a negative co-operativity between the profilin and DNase I binding sites on actin.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of $T1$$T2$ (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires $T1$$T2$-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein $T1$ binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with $T2$ being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on $T1$$T2$ to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or $T1$$T2$ and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions.

In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, $T1$ labeling, or $T2$ expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, $T1$$T2$ and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

In this model, profilin can bind both to actin monomers with a Kd of about 5 microM and to the barbed end of actin filaments with a Kd of about 50-100 microM. Quantitative analysis of the effect of Acanthamoeba profilin on actin filament nucleation and elongation. The current view of the mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin is that it binds to actin monomers, forming a complex that cannot polymerize [Tobacman, L. S., & Korn, E. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4166-4170; Tseng, P., & Pollard, T. D. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 94, 213-218; Tobacman, L. S., Brenner, S. L., & Korn, E. D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8806-8812].

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of $T1$$T2$ and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

The affinity of yeast $T1$ for rabbit $T2$ (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; $T1$ inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than $T2$; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between $T1$$T2$ disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits $T1$ to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of $T2$ polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on $T1$ in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of $T2$ cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of $T1$$T2$ and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

The ability of WIP to replace verprolin is dependent on its WH2 actin binding domain and a putative profilin binding domain. Thus, like verprolin, $T1$$T2$, WIP functions in yeast to link the polarity development pathway and the actin cytoskeleton to generate cytoskeletal asymmetry.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and $T1$$T2$ such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

By two-hybrid screening we have identified two partners that directly associate with TIF34: PRT1, a previously characterized eIF3 subunit, and a novel protein of 33 kDa (eIF3-p33) which is part of the eIF3 complex and has an RNA binding domain. Our results provide support for both physical and functional interactions between three subunits, TIF34, $T1$ and p33, in the $T2$ complex.

Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed profilin I to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric actin also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent DNase. The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an $T1$$T2$ functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) actobindin inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in $T1$, $T2$ and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, $T1$$T2$, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary binding site in alpha-catenin which mediates its interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds either beta-catenin or $T1$, which both can assemble $T2$ into the complex. Recently we have identified an alpha-catenin binding site in beta-catenin and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, $T1$$T2$, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between $T1$$T2$-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit $T1$$T2$ almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Depending on the nature of the divalent cation, recombinant plant (birch) profilin exhibited two different modes of interaction with actin, like mammalian $T1$$T2$ exhibited two different modes of interaction with actin, like mammalian profilin. In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from A:Tbeta4. Recombinant plant (birch) profilin was analyzed for its ability to promote actin polymerization from the actin:thymosin beta4 and beta9 complex. These data indicated a negative co-operativity between the profilin and DNase I binding sites on actin.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, $T1$ simply sequesters globular $T2$.

In vivo importance of actin nucleotide exchange catalyzed by profilin. act1-157, an actin mutant with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, suppressed defects in actin organization, cell growth, and fluid-phase endocytosis of pfy1-4, a profilin mutant defective in actin binding. The $T1$ monomer-binding protein, $T2$, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

In order to clarify cofilin-dependent regulation of $T1$$T2$-dependent regulation of actin assembly in muscle cells, cofilin tagged with fluorescence dyes was introduced into C2 myoblasts by a micro injection method. The exogeneous cofilin, but not ADF, caused quick disassembly of actin filaments and accumulated in furrow region of dividing cells. These results suggest that the subcellular distribution of cofilin as well as its interaction with actin in vivo is regulated by its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed profilin I to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric actin also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent DNase. The differential localization of the three $T1$ monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) $T2$ functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) actobindin inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and $T1$$T2$-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Although the chemical basis of these results is not known, they indicate that profilin can tightly sequester actin monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for $T1$$T2$ can tightly sequester actin monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for actin may be under metabolic control. Recent evidence that profilin inhibits phospholipase C and enhances nucleotide exchange of actin has led some to question whether profilin is ever truly an actin monomer sequestering agent.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of $T1$$T2$ in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

The mechanism of profilin-promoted actin polymerization has been systematically reinvestigated. When measured in the absence of profilin, actin assembly curves over a 0.7-4 microM thymosin-beta4 concentration range fit a simple monomer sequestering model (1 microM K(D) for Thymosin-beta4.Actin). With solutions of actin (2 microM) and $T1$ (2 or 4 microM), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing $T2$ concentration (0.7-2 microM).

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to $T1$$T2$ to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, $T1$ competed with the binding of $T2$ to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of $T1$ and PIP kinases and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of $T2$ in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin.

This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or $T1$$T2$ because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between $T1$$T2$ protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The $T1$ profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by $T2$. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while $T1$$T2$ appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly.

On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with $T1$$T2$ filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that $T1$ binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of $T2$ to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between $T1$ and $T2$ is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in $T1$ and $T2$ but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and $T1$$T2$ of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type $T1$ precipitated $T2$ from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, $T1$$T2$ expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

In this model, profilin can bind both to actin monomers with a Kd of about 5 microM and to the barbed end of actin filaments with a Kd of about 50-100 microM. Quantitative analysis of the effect of Acanthamoeba profilin on actin filament nucleation and elongation. The current view of the mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin is that it binds to actin monomers, forming a complex that cannot polymerize [Tobacman, L. S., & Korn, E. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4166-4170; Tseng, P., & Pollard, T. D. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 94, 213-218; Tobacman, L. S., Brenner, S. L., & Korn, E. D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8806-8812].

The mechanism of profilin-promoted actin polymerization has been systematically reinvestigated. When measured in the absence of profilin, actin assembly curves over a 0.7-4 microM $T1$ concentration range fit a simple monomer sequestering model (1 microM K(D) for Thymosin-beta4.$T2$). With solutions of actin (2 microM) and thymosin-beta4 (2 or 4 microM), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing profilin concentration (0.7-2 microM).

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to $T1$$T2$ and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric $T1$$T2$ binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from $T1$$T2$ correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of $T1$ ($T2$), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

The $T1$ binding site on $T2$ may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin. Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-catenin complexes.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for $T1$$T2$ filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for $T1$, the down-regulation of which was associated with $T2$ down-regulation.

Although the chemical basis of these results is not known, they indicate that profilin can tightly sequester actin monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for actin may be under metabolic control.

Class II profilins had higher affinity for poly-l-proline and sequestered more monomeric actin than did $T1$$T2$ than did class I profilins.

The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human $T1$$T2$-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and $T1$$T2$ and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between $T1$ and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in $T2$. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, $T1$, and $T2$. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either $T1$$T2$ and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

In order to clarify cofilin-dependent regulation of actin assembly in muscle cells, cofilin tagged with fluorescence dyes was introduced into C2 myoblasts by a micro injection method. The exogeneous $T1$, but not ADF, caused quick disassembly of $T2$ filaments and accumulated in furrow region of dividing cells. These results suggest that the subcellular distribution of cofilin as well as its interaction with actin in vivo is regulated by its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, $T1$ and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with $T2$, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short $T1$ filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of $T2$ polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and $T1$$T2$ molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and $T1$, but not $T2$, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and $T1$ is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in $T2$. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on $T1$$T2$ was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Reduced expressions of cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, $T1$, and $T2$) has been reported to be associated with tumor metastasis. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expressions in the metastatic foci of patients with colorectal carcinoma. RESULTS: Reduced normal expression of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin in comparison with normal epithelium was detected in 78 primary tumors, respectively.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the $T1$ exchanges between $T2$ monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical $T1$$T2$ is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit $T1$ (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit $T2$ (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in $T1$$T2$ in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which $T1$ stimulation recruits $T2$ to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that $T1$$T2$ inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

$T1$ is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with $T2$, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

Quantitative analysis of the effect of Acanthamoeba profilin on actin filament nucleation and elongation.

Chem. 257, 4166-4170; Tseng, P., & Pollard, T. D. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 94, 213-218; Tobacman, L. S., Brenner, S. L., & Korn, E. D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8806-8812].

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of $T1$$T2$ promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of $T1$$T2$ is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on $T1$$T2$ isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

In this model, profilin can bind both to actin monomers with a Kd of about 5 microM and to the barbed end of actin filaments with a Kd of about 50-100 microM. Quantitative analysis of the effect of Acanthamoeba $T1$ on $T2$ filament nucleation and elongation. The current view of the mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin is that it binds to actin monomers, forming a complex that cannot polymerize [Tobacman, L. S., & Korn, E. D. (1982) J. Biol.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of $T1$ and its monomer binding proteins, $T2$, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of $T1$, cofilin, and $T2$ in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that $T1$ may modulate the catalytic activities of $T2$ protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of $T1$$T2$ content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of $T1$$T2$, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of $T1$$T2$ filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The $T1$-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast $T2$ protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of $T1$$T2$ polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

A highly significant correlation was observed between the loss of expression of E-cadherin, $T1$ and gamma-catenin, but not $T2$, with increased TNM stage (p <0.05). Loss of normal surface E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin and gamma-catenin expression was found in 52/68 (76.4%) tumors, 57/68 (83.8%) tumors, 54/68 (79.4%) tumors and 54/68 (79.4%) tumors (p <0.001). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique to examine the cellular localization of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, gamma-catenin and E-cadherin in 68 TCC and 14 normal bladder biopsies.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet $T1$ with rabbit $T2$ were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled $T1$ (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit $T2$.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that $T1$$T2$ to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires $T1$ and $T2$, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Munc18-2 is a $T1$ homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with $T2$, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous $T1$$T2$ versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of $T1$ in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, $T2$, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of $T1$ in EGF-stimulated $T2$ polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The frequency-dependent effects of iodotubercidin (ITU, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase), draflazine (a nucleoside transport blocker), and PD81,723 (an allosteric enhancer of the $T1$$T2$), draflazine (a nucleoside transport blocker), and PD81,723 (an allosteric enhancer of the A1 adenosine receptor binding) on the stimulus-to-His bundle (SH) interval, a measure of AV nodal conduction, were determined in guinea pig hearts and compared with those of adenosine and diltiazem. The AV nodal effects of draflazine, ITU, EHNA, and PD81,723 were reversed by the A1 adenosine receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline and adenosine deaminase, implicating endogenous adenosine acting at the A1 adenosine receptor.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast $T1$ was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast $T2$ almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Depending on the nature of the divalent cation, recombinant plant (birch) profilin exhibited two different modes of interaction with actin, like mammalian profilin. In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from A:Tbeta4. Recombinant plant (birch) profilin was analyzed for its ability to promote actin polymerization from the actin:thymosin beta4 and beta9 complex. These data indicated a negative co-operativity between the $T1$ and DNase I binding sites on $T2$.

These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and $T1$$T2$ activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.

Analysis of the formation of the calf spleen complex in the presence of varying concentrations of divalent cations gave evidence for the presence of a high-affinity divalent-cation-binding site on the spleen actin (beta, gamma) which appears to regulate the interaction with $T1$$T2$ (beta, gamma) which appears to regulate the interaction with profilin. The interaction between calf spleen profilin and actin depends critically on the status of the C-terminus of the actin, and in the case of profilin, the C-terminus is of great importance for the physiochemical behaviour of the protein.

Here we show that the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system is involved in the regulation of beta-catenin turnover. beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin, $T1$(cas) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when $T2$-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.

Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-catenin complexes.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit $T1$$T2$ with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with $T1$$T2$ has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a $T1$$T2$, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

There are three histone H3 genes, two of which are identical; four histone H2a genes, two of which are identical, one histone H4 gene; and two histone H2b genes. These histone H3 and H2a genes encode approximately 40% of the total H3 and H2a mRNA, whereas the histone $T1$ and histone H2b genes encode < 10% of the total $T2$ and H2b mRNA.

On the basis of these results, we present a model for prereplicative site formation in infected cells in which the helicase-primase components (UL5, UL8, and $T1$$T2$ components (UL5, UL8, and UL52), the origin-binding protein (UL9), and the viral single-stranded DNA-binding protein (ICP8) assemble together to initiate the process. We observed that four replication proteins, UL5, UL8 UL52, and UL9, are necessary for the localization of ICP8 (UL29) to prereplicative sites natural infection conditions.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of $T1$$T2$ in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and $T1$, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with $T2$, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin.

This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as $T1$$T2$ and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

In this model, $T1$ can bind both to actin monomers with a Kd of about 5 microM and to the barbed end of $T2$ filaments with a Kd of about 50-100 microM. Quantitative analysis of the effect of Acanthamoeba profilin on actin filament nucleation and elongation. The current view of the mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin is that it binds to actin monomers, forming a complex that cannot polymerize [Tobacman, L. S., & Korn, E. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4166-4170; Tseng, P., & Pollard, T. D. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 94, 213-218; Tobacman, L. S., Brenner, S. L., & Korn, E. D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8806-8812].

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of $T1$$T2$, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of $T1$$T2$ filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous $T1$ $T2$. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

A highly significant correlation was observed between the loss of expression of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin and gamma-catenin, but not beta-catenin, with increased TNM stage (p <0.05). Loss of normal surface E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin and gamma-catenin expression was found in 52/68 (76.4%) tumors, 57/68 (83.8%) tumors, 54/68 (79.4%) tumors and 54/68 (79.4%) tumors (p <0.001). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique to examine the cellular localization of $T1$, beta-catenin, $T2$ and E-cadherin in 68 TCC and 14 normal bladder biopsies. RESULTS: E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin and gamma-catenin were expressed in a normal membranous pattern in all normal bladder epithelium specimens.

However, upon treatment with DMSO, cytoplasmic actin filaments were disrupted and intranuclear rod structures containing cofilin and actin were apparently larger and thicker in cells overexpressing cofilin than in normal cells. In cultured cells, cofilin, as well as $T1$, translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus together with $T2$ and forms rod-like structures in response to heat shock or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) treatment.

Depending on the nature of the divalent cation, recombinant plant (birch) profilin exhibited two different modes of interaction with actin, like mammalian profilin. In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from $T1$$T2$ from A:Tbeta4. Recombinant plant (birch) profilin was analyzed for its ability to promote actin polymerization from the actin:thymosin beta4 and beta9 complex. These data indicated a negative co-operativity between the profilin and DNase I binding sites on actin.

The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a $T1$$T2$ homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, $T1$$T2$ bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, $T1$, and $T2$ has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC).

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and $T1$$T2$ and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Coexpression of the A8R and A23R genes in Escherichia coli was required for in vitro activity.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The $T1$ profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with $T2$ being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human $T1$ for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two $T2$. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

The affinity of yeast $T1$ for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit $T2$ (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics.

Other than monomeric actin, no major profilin ligands are detected in crude extracts. Our results show that the major pool of polymerizable actin monomers is complexed with profilin and spread throughout the cytoplasm. Selective monoclonal antibodies confirm that most of the profilin is bound to actin: 65% in extract immunoadsorption assays and 74-89% by fluorescent antibody staining. We used biochemical fractionation, immunoassays and microscopy of live and fixed Acanthamoeba to determine how much profilin is bound to its known ligands: actin, membrane PIP(2), $T1$$T2$, membrane PIP(2), Arp2/3 complex and polyproline sequences.

Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary binding site in alpha-catenin which mediates its interaction with beta-catenin and $T1$$T2$ and plakoglobin.

Recently we have identified an alpha-catenin binding site in beta-catenin and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism.

The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or $T1$ and $T2$.

Here we identify a pathway for the regulation of cofilin, a ubiquitous actin-binding protein that is essential for effective depolymerization of actin filaments. Our results define a mechanism for the regulation of cofilin and hence of actin dynamics in vivo. Phosphorylation by LIM-kinase 1 inactivates cofilin, leading to accumulation of actin filaments.

We report here that tropomyosin, which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core, can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores, and can cause the dissociation of up to 30% of the villin and $T1$ from the cores but does not affect actin binding by 110-kD $T2$.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with $T1$$T2$ with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and $T1$$T2$, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of $T1$ for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three $T2$ isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) $T1$ functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) $T2$ regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) actobindin inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

A binary complex of birch profilin and skeletal muscle actin could be isolated by gel chromatography. Birch profilin increased the critical concentration required for muscle and brain actin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner, supporting the notion of the formation of a heterologous complex between the plant protein and animal actin. Interaction of plant profilin with mammalian actin. In viscometric assays, the birch protein was seen to modulate $T1$ filament formation analogous to animal $T2$. These data indicate that the actin-binding domains in plant and animal profilins are functionally highly conserved, although the overall sequence similarity is less than 25%.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by $T1$, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in $T2$. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC).

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive $T1$ assembly off of the pool of $T2$-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit $T1$$T2$ was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, $T1$, and $T2$ in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in $T1$$T2$ but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Although the chemical basis of these results is not known, they indicate that profilin can tightly sequester actin monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of $T1$$T2$ can tightly sequester actin monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for actin may be under metabolic control. Recent evidence that profilin inhibits phospholipase C and enhances nucleotide exchange of actin has led some to question whether profilin is ever truly an actin monomer sequestering agent.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that $T1$$T2$ monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl.

Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled $T1$ binds $T2$2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and $T1$$T2$ is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and $T1$$T2$ and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and $T1$$T2$ and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated $T1$$T2$ in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical $T1$$T2$-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Detection of loss of heterozygosity at RAD51, RAD52, $T1$ and $T2$ and BRCA2 loci in breast cancer: pathological correlations. LOH was found in the RAD51 region in 32% of tumours, in the RAD52 region in 16%, in RAD54 in 20% and in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 regions in 49% and 44% respectively. We investigate allelic losses in microsatellites of the RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, BRCA1 and BRCA2 regions, and their correlations with nine pathologic parameters in 127 breast carcinomas.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations.

Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor $T1$$T2$ also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Although the chemical basis of these results is not known, they indicate that $T1$ can tightly sequester $T2$ monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for actin may be under metabolic control. Recent evidence that profilin inhibits phospholipase C and enhances nucleotide exchange of actin has led some to question whether profilin is ever truly an actin monomer sequestering agent.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that $T1$ binds to $T2$ filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate $T1$ assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized $T2$ content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow.

We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Characterization of the interactions of alpha-catenin with $T1$$T2$ with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/plakoglobin. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric $T1$$T2$ isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-$T1$$T2$), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical $T1$$T2$ localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly.

The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) $T1$ functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) $T2$ inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear $T1$$T2$ colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

ADP-ribosylation of actin at Arg 177 by Clostridium perfringens $T1$ increased the nucleotide dissociation rate from 2.2 x 10(-3) s-1 to 4.5 x 10(-3) s-1 without affecting the $T2$-induced stimulation of nucleotide exchange. In contrast, ADP-ribosylation of actin at Arg95/Arg372 induced by turkey erythrocyte transferase decreased the nucleotide dissociation rate to 1.5 x 10(3) s-1 and inhibited the profilin-induced stimulation of nucleotide exchange.

Depending on the nature of the divalent cation, recombinant plant (birch) profilin exhibited two different modes of interaction with actin, like mammalian profilin. In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from A:Tbeta4. Recombinant plant (birch) profilin was analyzed for its ability to promote actin polymerization from the actin:$T1$$T2$ and beta9 complex. These data indicated a negative co-operativity between the profilin and DNase I binding sites on actin.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit $T1$ with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast $T2$. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, $T1$, and $T2$ were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments.

Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of $T1$ in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized $T2$ associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Other than monomeric $T1$, no major $T2$ ligands are detected in crude extracts. Our results show that the major pool of polymerizable actin monomers is complexed with profilin and spread throughout the cytoplasm. Selective monoclonal antibodies confirm that most of the profilin is bound to actin: 65% in extract immunoadsorption assays and 74-89% by fluorescent antibody staining. We used biochemical fractionation, immunoassays and microscopy of live and fixed Acanthamoeba to determine how much profilin is bound to its known ligands: actin, membrane PIP(2), Arp2/3 complex and polyproline sequences.

Reinvestigation of the inhibition of actin polymerization by profilin. The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified $T1$ explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled $T2$.

Characterization of the interactions of alpha-catenin with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/plakoglobin. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the $T1$$T2$ binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that $T1$$T2$ raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not $T1$, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and $T2$, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of $T1$$T2$ mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and $T1$$T2$ protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with $T1$$T2$ and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast $T1$$T2$ yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, $T1$, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with $T2$ down-regulation.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound $T1$, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit $T2$.

Compared with control and contralateral kidneys, the ligated kidneys displayed a dynamic expression of mRNAs for many apoptosis-related molecules, which included an up to threefold increase for Fas, Fas ligand, TNF-R1, TRAIL, TRADD, RIP, and caspase-8, and an up to twofold increase for FADD and FAP, but there was little change for FAF. To detect the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, ribonuclease protection assay was used with specific antisense RNA probes for Fas, Fas ligand, TNFR-1, $T1$$T2$, TNFR-1, TRAIL, FADD, TRADD, RIP, FAF, FAP, and caspase-8.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, $T1$$T2$ was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Although $T1$ released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate $T2$ assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit $T1$ (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two $T2$. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing $T1$, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with $T2$ supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

The mechanism of profilin-promoted actin polymerization has been systematically reinvestigated. When measured in the absence of profilin, actin assembly curves over a 0.7-4 microM $T1$$T2$ assembly curves over a 0.7-4 microM thymosin-beta4 concentration range fit a simple monomer sequestering model (1 microM K(D) for Thymosin-beta4.Actin).

The affinity of yeast $T1$ for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human $T2$ for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate $T1$ assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of $T2$ released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, $T1$$T2$-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and large protein (L) genes were partly determined for 19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan (nucleotide position N: 1301-1700, $T1$: 1751-2190, $T2$: 3571-4057, F: 6621-7210, L: 10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of $T1$$T2$ at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, $T1$$T2$ was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

In extracts from mouse brain, profilin I and profilin II can form complexes with regulators of endocytosis, synaptic vesicle recycling and $T1$$T2$ and profilin II can form complexes with regulators of endocytosis, synaptic vesicle recycling and actin assembly. In mouse brain profilin I and profilin II associate with regulators of the endocytic pathway and actin assembly. Our findings strongly suggest that in brain profilin I and profilin II complexes link the actin cytoskeleton and endocytic membrane flow, directing actin and clathrin assembly to distinct membrane domains.

Immunolocalization of $T1$ (E-cad), $T2$, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in $T1$$T2$ in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and $T1$$T2$ and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide.

CONCLUSIONS: The expression of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin is related to histological type and differentiation in NSCLC, although $T1$$T2$ is related to histological type and differentiation in NSCLC, although catenins have no independent prognostic value. Reduced expression of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin is associated with high cell proliferative activity and poor differentiation in non-small cell lung cancer.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and $T1$$T2$, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Other than monomeric actin, no major profilin ligands are detected in crude extracts. Our results show that the major pool of polymerizable actin monomers is complexed with profilin and spread throughout the cytoplasm. Selective monoclonal antibodies confirm that most of the profilin is bound to actin: 65% in extract immunoadsorption assays and 74-89% by fluorescent antibody staining. We used biochemical fractionation, immunoassays and microscopy of live and fixed Acanthamoeba to determine how much $T1$ is bound to its known ligands: $T2$, membrane PIP(2), Arp2/3 complex and polyproline sequences.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC).

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the $T1$$T2$ mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with $T1$$T2$ required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Direct binding of the verprolin-homology domain in N-WASP to actin is essential for cytoskeletal reorganization. Recently, two mammalian proteins previously shown to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein ($T1$$T2$ cytoskeleton, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) and its homolog expressed in neurons (N-WASP), were found to possess short peptide motifs homologous to one part of verprolin.

Immunolocalization of $T1$ (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and $T2$ has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to $T1$ filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of $T2$ to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate $T1$ polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that $T2$ might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

In cultured cells, cofilin, as well as ADF, translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus together with actin and forms rod-like structures in response to heat shock or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) treatment.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of $T1$ promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of $T2$-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from $T1$$T2$ from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The $T1$ $T2$ binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in $T1$-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of $T2$ relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of $T1$, alpha-catenin, and $T2$ expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

The binding constants of Acanthamoeba profilin to fluorescein-labeled actin from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added profilin concentration. These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled $T1$ is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include $T2$.

Other than monomeric actin, no major profilin ligands are detected in crude extracts. Our results show that the major pool of polymerizable actin monomers is complexed with profilin and spread throughout the cytoplasm. Selective monoclonal antibodies confirm that most of the profilin is bound to actin: 65% in extract immunoadsorption assays and 74-89% by fluorescent antibody staining. We used biochemical fractionation, immunoassays and microscopy of live and fixed Acanthamoeba to determine how much profilin is bound to its known ligands: actin, membrane PIP(2), $T1$$T2$, membrane PIP(2), Arp2/3 complex and polyproline sequences.

Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by $T1$. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of $T2$ polymerization.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and $T1$$T2$ mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the $T1$$T2$ may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of $T1$ and restricts cofilin localization to cortical $T2$ patches.

Reinvestigation of the inhibition of actin polymerization by profilin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; $T1$$T2$ has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, $T1$$T2$ monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

The essential role of profilin in the assembly of $T1$$T2$ in the assembly of actin for microspike formation. These findings provide the first evidence that profilin is a key molecule linking a signaling network to rapid actin polymerization in microspike formation.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, $T1$$T2$, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC).

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to $T1$$T2$ molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of $T1$, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, $T2$ expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to $T1$$T2$ concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of $T1$ for monomeric $T2$, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

A 2.2-kb truncated NRP1 cDNA was cloned that encodes a 644-aa soluble NRP1 (sNRP1) isoform containing just the a/$T1$$T2$ cDNA was cloned that encodes a 644-aa soluble NRP1 (sNRP1) isoform containing just the a/CUB and b/coagulation factor homology extracellular domains of NRP1. sNRP1 is secreted by cells as a 90-kDa protein that binds VEGF(165), but not VEGF(121).

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of $T1$ for barbed ends of $T2$ filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

The mechanism of $T1$-promoted $T2$ polymerization has been systematically reinvestigated. When measured in the absence of profilin, actin assembly curves over a 0.7-4 microM thymosin-beta4 concentration range fit a simple monomer sequestering model (1 microM K(D) for Thymosin-beta4.Actin). With solutions of actin (2 microM) and thymosin-beta4 (2 or 4 microM), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing profilin concentration (0.7-2 microM).

Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and $T1$-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled $T2$ (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of $T1$ in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with $T2$, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

The binding constants of Acanthamoeba profilin to fluorescein-labeled actin from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added $T1$$T2$ from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added profilin concentration. These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled actin is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include profilin.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human $T1$ for rabbit $T2$ (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

CONCLUSIONS: The expression of $T1$, $T2$, and gamma-catenin is related to histological type and differentiation in NSCLC, although catenins have no independent prognostic value. Reduced expression of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin is associated with high cell proliferative activity and poor differentiation in non-small cell lung cancer.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of $T1$ promote extensive $T2$ assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a $T1$$T2$ is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Reduced expressions of cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin) has been reported to be associated with tumor metastasis. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of E-cadherin, $T1$$T2$, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expressions in the metastatic foci of patients with colorectal carcinoma. RESULTS: Reduced normal expression of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin in comparison with normal epithelium was detected in 78 primary tumors, respectively.

Characterization of $T1$ and poly-L-proline binding sites of Acanthamoeba $T2$ with monoclonal antibodies and by mutagenesis. For example, profilin with a deletion of the eight C-terminal residues has many of the physical properties of a molten globule, yet remarkably still binds to actin. The results provide two independent lines of evidence about the binding sites for actin and poly-L-proline on the profilin molecule.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the $T1$$T2$ subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed $T1$ to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric $T2$ also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent DNase. The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) actobindin inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

Here we show that the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system is involved in the regulation of beta-catenin turnover. $T1$, but not E-cadherin, p120(cas) or $T2$, becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of $T1$ relative to free barbed ends and characterized the $T2$ dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

The mechanism of profilin-promoted actin polymerization has been systematically reinvestigated.

With solutions of actin (2 microM) and thymosin-beta4 (2 or 4 microM), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing profilin concentration (0.7-2 microM).

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that $T1$$T2$ is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed profilin I to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric $T1$ also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent $T2$. The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) actobindin inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC).

In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of $T1$$T2$ is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

High levels of profilin suppress the lethality caused by overproduction of actin in yeast cells. In contrast, overexpression of the profilin gene, PFY1, encoding an actin-binding protein, leads to no very obvious phenotype. Interestingly, profilin overproduction can compensate for the deleterious effects of too much actin in a $T1$$T2$ overproduction can compensate for the deleterious effects of too much actin in a profilin concentration-dependent manner.

The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly. To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and $T1$$T2$ was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Although $T1$ released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from $T2$ too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When $T1$ was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen $T2$ isoform, ZmPRO1.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit $T1$ (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two $T2$. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with $T1$$T2$. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, $T1$ and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but $T2$ appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Depending on the nature of the divalent cation, recombinant plant (birch) profilin exhibited two different modes of interaction with actin, like mammalian profilin. In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from A:Tbeta4. Recombinant plant (birch) profilin was analyzed for its ability to promote $T1$ polymerization from the $T2$:thymosin beta4 and beta9 complex. These data indicated a negative co-operativity between the profilin and DNase I binding sites on actin.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds $T1$ and cross-links $T2$ filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and $T1$$T2$, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow.

We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC).

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and $T1$$T2$ and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which $T1$ stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short $T2$ filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of $T1$$T2$ bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous $T1$$T2$ H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of $T1$$T2$ polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with $T1$$T2$; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled actin is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include profilin.

Although the chemical basis of these results is not known, they indicate that profilin can tightly sequester actin monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for actin may be under metabolic control.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not $T1$, $T2$, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on $T1$$T2$ molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

The findings suggest that M1 $T1$ are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of $T2$ production.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble $T1$$T2$ was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

$T1$ interacts with $T2$ to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal regions of talin disrupt actin stress fibers when microinjected into human fibroblasts. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule. To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional $T1$ fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and $T2$ binding.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of $T1$$T2$ has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of $T1$ that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit $T2$.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and $T1$ but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of $T2$ in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit $T1$$T2$ and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of $T1$$T2$ binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

Characterization of the interactions of alpha-catenin with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/plakoglobin. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the $T1$; alpha-catenin binds to $T2$/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

The mechanism of profilin-promoted actin polymerization has been systematically reinvestigated. When measured in the absence of $T1$, $T2$ assembly curves over a 0.7-4 microM thymosin-beta4 concentration range fit a simple monomer sequestering model (1 microM K(D) for Thymosin-beta4.Actin). With solutions of actin (2 microM) and thymosin-beta4 (2 or 4 microM), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing profilin concentration (0.7-2 microM).

The binding constants of Acanthamoeba profilin to fluorescein-labeled actin from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added $T1$$T2$ tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added profilin concentration. These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled actin is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include profilin.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, $T1$$T2$ and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: $T1$ has different effects on elongation at the two ends of $T2$ filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

To detect the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, ribonuclease protection assay was used with specific antisense RNA probes for Fas, Fas ligand, TNFR-1, TRAIL, FADD, TRADD, RIP, FAF, FAP, and $T1$$T2$, Fas ligand, TNFR-1, TRAIL, FADD, TRADD, RIP, FAF, FAP, and caspase-8.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with $T1$$T2$ expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. $T1$ localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific $T2$ and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of $T1$$T2$ were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin gene (PFY1) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the $T1$$T2$ in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized $T1$$T2$ content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While $T1$ has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of $T2$ is not yet fully understood.

The affinity of yeast $T1$ for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two $T2$. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal regions of talin disrupt actin stress fibers when microinjected into human fibroblasts. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the $T1$$T2$, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule. To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and actin binding.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of $T1$ promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-$T2$ complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between $T1$ and alpha-catenin is mediated by $T2$, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to $T1$$T2$ and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Characterization of the interactions of alpha-catenin with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/plakoglobin. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/$T1$ and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the $T2$ cytoskeleton.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for $T1$$T2$ has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit $T1$ with human $T2$ yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: $T1$ has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of $T2$ much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Fluorescent $T1$ analogs with a high affinity for $T2$ in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

The higher affinity of vaccinia profilin for polyphosphoinositides (Kd = 0.2-8.5 microM) than for actin or poly(L-proline) and the concentration of vaccinia profilin expressed in infected HeLa cells (approximately 20 microM) suggest that vaccinia profilin binds preferentially to PIP and PIP2 in vivo. We expressed in Escherichia coli the vaccinia virus gene for a protein similar to vertebrate $T1$, purified the recombinant viral profilin, and characterized its interactions with $T2$ and polyphosphoinositides.

Here we show that the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system is involved in the regulation of beta-catenin turnover. beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin, p120(cas) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when $T1$-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of $T2$.

Changes in beta-catenin binding to $T1$$T2$ binding to cadherin or APC protein, and the ensuing effects on cell morphology and adhesion, are independent of beta-catenin binding to alpha-catenin. Full-length beta-catenin, beta-catenin mutant proteins with NH2-terminal deletions before (deltaN90) or after (deltaN131, deltaN151) the alpha-catenin binding site, or a mutant beta-catenin with a COOH-terminal deletion (delta C) were expressed in MDCK cells under the control of the tetracycline-repressible transactivator.

Arp2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links actin filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds $T1$/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of $T2$ filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary binding site in alpha-catenin which mediates its interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds either beta-catenin or $T1$$T2$ binds either beta-catenin or plakoglobin, which both can assemble alpha-catenin into the complex. Recently we have identified an alpha-catenin binding site in beta-catenin and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC).

Interaction of plant profilin with mammalian actin. In viscometric assays, the birch protein was seen to modulate actin filament formation analogous to animal profilin.

$T1$ is generally thought to regulate $T2$ polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Although platelets contain only 1 $T1$ for every 5-10 $T2$ molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of $T1$$T2$ in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and $T1$$T2$ and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of $T1$$T2$ dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short $T1$$T2$ to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, $T1$$T2$, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of $T1$ that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and $T2$-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or $T1$ may be responsible for the nuclear import of $T2$ in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

There are three histone H3 genes, two of which are identical; four histone H2a genes, two of which are identical, one histone H4 gene; and two histone H2b genes. These histone H3 and H2a genes encode approximately 40% of the total H3 and $T1$$T2$ genes encode approximately 40% of the total H3 and H2a mRNA, whereas the histone H4 and histone H2b genes encode < 10% of the total H4 and H2b mRNA.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than $T1$$T2$ much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of $T1$$T2$ relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Other than monomeric actin, no major profilin ligands are detected in crude extracts. Our results show that the major pool of polymerizable actin monomers is complexed with profilin and spread throughout the cytoplasm. Selective monoclonal antibodies confirm that most of the profilin is bound to actin: 65% in extract immunoadsorption assays and 74-89% by fluorescent antibody staining. We used biochemical fractionation, immunoassays and microscopy of live and fixed Acanthamoeba to determine how much $T1$ is bound to its known ligands: actin, membrane PIP(2), $T2$2/3 complex and polyproline sequences.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of $T1$ released from $T2$ too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Reversible binding of actin to gelsolin and profilin in human platelet extracts. Sepharose beads coupled to either monoclonal anti-gelsolin antibodies or to polyproline were used to extract $T1$ and $T2$, respectively, from EGTA-containing platelet extracts and determine the proportion of these molecules bound to actin with sufficient affinity to withstand dilution (high-affinity complexes). Thrombin, within seconds, caused quantitative conversion of platelet profilin and gelsolin to high-affinity complexes with actin, but these complexes were not present 5 min after stimulation.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal regions of talin disrupt actin stress fibers when microinjected into human fibroblasts. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule. To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional $T1$$T2$ stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and actin binding.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and $T1$$T2$ and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that $T1$$T2$ filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Here we show that the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system is involved in the regulation of beta-catenin turnover. beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin, p120($T1$$T2$, p120(cas) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; $T1$ inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with $T2$ cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of $T1$$T2$ in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of $T1$$T2$ isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of $T1$ with a high affinity for $T2$ revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of $T1$ in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with $T2$, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts $T1$$T2$-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Other than monomeric actin, no major profilin ligands are detected in crude extracts. Our results show that the major pool of polymerizable actin monomers is complexed with profilin and spread throughout the cytoplasm.

Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed $T1$ to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric actin also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent $T2$. The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) actobindin inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or $T1$$T2$ and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between $T1$ and $T2$: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for cadherin function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the $T1$$T2$ mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized $T1$$T2$ in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in $T1$$T2$ in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism.

The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

With $T1$, whose sequestering activity was low, the concentration of free $T2$ monomers observed at steady-state of polymerization [Afree], was close to that seen with actin alone ([Acc], critical concentration of polymerization).

Biochemical complementation experiments also indicate that the PRP9 and PRP11 proteins interact. Four yeast spliceosomal proteins ($T1$, PRP9, PRP11, and $T2$) interact to promote U2 snRNP binding to pre-mRNA.

Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary binding site in alpha-catenin which mediates its interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds either beta-catenin or plakoglobin, which both can assemble alpha-catenin into the complex. Recently we have identified an $T1$ binding site in beta-catenin and $T2$ and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism.

High levels of profilin suppress the lethality caused by overproduction of actin in yeast cells. In contrast, overexpression of the profilin gene, PFY1, encoding an $T1$$T2$ gene, PFY1, encoding an actin-binding protein, leads to no very obvious phenotype. Interestingly, profilin overproduction can compensate for the deleterious effects of too much actin in a profilin concentration-dependent manner.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to $T1$ filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to $T2$ monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow.

We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and $T1$$T2$ and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

A truncated beta-catenin disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin: a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines. However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type beta-catenin precipitated alpha-catenin from these cells. These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with alpha-catenin, and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin. Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin. While alpha-catenin has been demonstrated to be crucial for $T1$ function, the role of $T2$ is not yet fully understood.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized $T1$ content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from $T2$ too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC).

In the presence of magnesium ions birch profilin promoted the polymerization of actin from A:Tbeta4. Recombinant plant (birch) profilin was analyzed for its ability to promote actin polymerization from the actin:$T1$$T2$:thymosin beta4 and beta9 complex.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow.

By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that $T1$$T2$ H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.

These results suggest that LIMK2 functions downstream of the Rho-ROCK signalling pathway and plays a role in reorganization of actin filaments and membrane structures, by phosphorylating cofilin/ADF proteins. We report here that LIMK1 and LIMK2 phosphorylate both $T1$ and $T2$ (ADF) specifically at Ser-3 and exhibit partially distinct substrate specificity when tested using site-directed cofilin mutants as substrates.

Profilin II binds actin with a similar affinity to that of profilin I, although it inhibits actin polymerization more strongly than $T1$$T2$ polymerization more strongly than profilin I under non-equilibrium conditions. Since functional characteristics for profilin II are lacking, we assayed the actin, the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and the poly(L-proline) binding properties of this isoform.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and $T1$$T2$, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but $T1$$T2$ rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to $T1$$T2$ to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/$T1$$T2$; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

Birch pollen profilin and actin can be copurified as a complex, and purified recombinant birch profilin can be used as an affinity matrix to obtain birch pollen actin. In this study, profilin is identified as an actin-binding protein in higher plants which is present in monocot and dicot angiosperms. The binding of 125I-labeled recombinant birch pollen profilin to plant and animal $T1$$T2$ to plant and animal actins can be blocked by profilin-specific antibodies that react with different epitopes of birch profilin.

The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified $T1$, histone $T2$ in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).

Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed profilin I to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric actin also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent DNase. The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an $T1$ monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) $T2$ inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

The binding constants of Acanthamoeba $T1$ to fluorescein-labeled $T2$ from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added profilin concentration. These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled actin is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include profilin.

Here, we prepared a profilin mutant (H119E) defective in actin binding, but retaining the ability to bind to other proteins. The essential role of profilin in the assembly of actin for microspike formation. These findings provide the first evidence that profilin is a key molecule linking a signaling network to rapid actin polymerization in microspike formation. This mutant $T1$ suppresses $T2$ polymerization in microspike formation induced by N-WASP, the essential factor in microspike formation.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of $T1$ (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with $T2$ supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound $T1$, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled $T2$ (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in $T1$$T2$ and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, $T1$$T2$, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of $T1$ may have important consequences for the regulation of $T2$ cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin ($T1$$T2$ (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast $T1$$T2$ and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or $T1$$T2$, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric actin, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three profilin isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, $T1$$T2$ isoform, ZmPRO1.

The AV nodal effects of draflazine, ITU, EHNA, and PD81,723 were reversed by the A1 adenosine receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline and adenosine deaminase, implicating endogenous adenosine acting at the A1 adenosine receptor.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein $T1$ binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of $T2$ polymerization.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and $T1$$T2$, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

The mechanism of profilin-promoted actin polymerization has been systematically reinvestigated. When measured in the absence of profilin, actin assembly curves over a 0.7-4 microM thymosin-beta4 concentration range fit a simple monomer sequestering model (1 microM K(D) for Thymosin-beta4.Actin). With solutions of $T1$ (2 microM) and $T2$ (2 or 4 microM), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing profilin concentration (0.7-2 microM).

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and $T1$ proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with $T2$ and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the $T1$ monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of $T2$ filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate $T1$$T2$ at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, $T1$$T2$ mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of $T1$ that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled $T2$ (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique to examine the cellular localization of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, gamma-catenin and E-cadherin in 68 TCC and 14 normal bladder biopsies. RESULTS: E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin and gamma-catenin were expressed in a normal membranous pattern in all normal bladder epithelium specimens.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that $T1$ increases the monomeric $T2$ to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

$T1$ is a $T2$ homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

The higher affinity of vaccinia profilin for polyphosphoinositides (Kd = 0.2-8.5 microM) than for actin or poly(L-proline) and the concentration of vaccinia profilin expressed in infected HeLa cells (approximately 20 microM) suggest that vaccinia $T1$$T2$ or poly(L-proline) and the concentration of vaccinia profilin expressed in infected HeLa cells (approximately 20 microM) suggest that vaccinia profilin binds preferentially to PIP and PIP2 in vivo.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of $T1$-$T2$ complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on actin in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells. Recently, we characterized several profilin isoforms from maize pollen for their ability to alter cytoarchitecture when microinjected into living plant cells and for their association with poly-L-proline and monomeric actin from maize pollen. The affinity of ZmPRO4 for monomeric $T1$, which was measured by two independent methods, is similar to that of the three $T2$ isoforms previously identified in pollen. When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on actin-dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform, ZmPRO1.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in $T1$ and ADF but not in actin, $T2$ and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive $T1$$T2$), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Reduced expressions of cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin) has been reported to be associated with tumor metastasis. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expressions in the metastatic foci of patients with colorectal carcinoma. RESULTS: Reduced normal expression of $T1$, $T2$, and beta-catenin in comparison with normal epithelium was detected in 78 primary tumors, respectively.

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect $T1$$T2$ or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of $T1$$T2$; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for $T1$ revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of $T2$ assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2.

This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect $T1$$T2$ do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

The core, isolated in the absence of free Ca2+, contains five major proteins: the actin (Mr 43 000) that makes up the filaments, the $T1$ (Mr 95 000) and $T2$ (Mr 68 000) that cross-link the filaments together, and the 110 000 Mr polypeptide-calmodulin complex that makes up cross-filaments which project laterally from the core and link it to the inner surface of the microvillus membrane.

$T1$ such as $T2$ and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The frequency-dependent effects of iodotubercidin (ITU, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase), draflazine (a nucleoside transport blocker), and PD81,723 (an allosteric enhancer of the A1 adenosine receptor binding) on the stimulus-to-His bundle (SH) interval, a measure of AV nodal conduction, were determined in guinea pig hearts and compared with those of adenosine and diltiazem. The AV nodal effects of draflazine, ITU, EHNA, and PD81,723 were reversed by the A1 adenosine receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline and $T1$$T2$ antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline and adenosine deaminase, implicating endogenous adenosine acting at the A1 adenosine receptor.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit $T1$ (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human $T2$ for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal regions of talin disrupt actin stress fibers when microinjected into human fibroblasts. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule. To investigate the possibility that $T1$ disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal $T2$ binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and actin binding.

A model is proposed for the function of profilin in actin-based motility. As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of $T1$$T2$), low amounts of profilin promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex. How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that $T1$ is a $T2$-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble $T1$, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and $T2$ were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with $T1$$T2$ much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

Although $T1$ released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized $T2$ content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation. Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2. We examined the role of the actin monomer sequestering protein, profilin, in the regulation of PMN actin filament assembly during chemoattractant stimulation using a Triton extraction method.

The binding constants of Acanthamoeba profilin to fluorescein-labeled actin from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the $T1$$T2$ from Acanthamoeba and from rabbit skeletal muscle have been determined by measuring the reduction in the actin tracer diffusion coefficients, determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery, as a function of added profilin concentration. These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of profilin on the assembly of actin that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374. These results place important restrictions on the interpretation of experiments in which fluorescently labeled actin is used as a probe of living cytoplasm or cytoplasmic extracts that include profilin.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate $T1$ polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of $T2$ and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The $T1$ profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of $T2$ polymerization.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of $T1$, $T2$, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Although the chemical basis of these results is not known, they indicate that profilin can tightly sequester actin monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for $T1$$T2$ monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for actin may be under metabolic control. Recent evidence that profilin inhibits phospholipase C and enhances nucleotide exchange of actin has led some to question whether profilin is ever truly an actin monomer sequestering agent.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than $T1$$T2$ has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts. We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

On the basis of these results, we present a model for prereplicative site formation in infected cells in which the helicase-primase components (UL5, UL8, and UL52), the origin-binding protein (UL9), and the viral single-stranded DNA-binding protein (ICP8) assemble together to initiate the process. We observed that four replication proteins, UL5, UL8 UL52, and $T1$$T2$ UL52, and UL9, are necessary for the localization of ICP8 (UL29) to prereplicative sites natural infection conditions.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the $T1$$T2$, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

In order to clarify cofilin-dependent regulation of actin assembly in muscle cells, $T1$$T2$-dependent regulation of actin assembly in muscle cells, cofilin tagged with fluorescence dyes was introduced into C2 myoblasts by a micro injection method. The exogeneous cofilin, but not ADF, caused quick disassembly of actin filaments and accumulated in furrow region of dividing cells. These results suggest that the subcellular distribution of cofilin as well as its interaction with actin in vivo is regulated by its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

$T1$ interacts with cofilin to disassemble $T2$ filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that $T1$$T2$ and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the $T1$ protein and the $T2$ and MSH6 proteins. Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

On the basis of these results, we present a model for prereplicative site formation in infected cells in which the helicase-primase components (UL5, UL8, and UL52), the origin-binding protein (UL9), and the viral single-stranded DNA-binding protein (ICP8) assemble together to initiate the process. We observed that four replication proteins, UL5, UL8 $T1$$T2$, UL8 UL52, and UL9, are necessary for the localization of ICP8 (UL29) to prereplicative sites natural infection conditions.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal regions of talin disrupt actin stress fibers when microinjected into human fibroblasts. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule. To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional $T1$$T2$ binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and actin binding.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with $T1$ and $T2$. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Thus, the $T1$-binding dodecapeptide sequence of cofilin may constitute a multifunctional domain in $T2$.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal regions of talin disrupt actin stress fibers when microinjected into human fibroblasts. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule. To investigate the possibility that $T1$ disrupts $T2$ stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and actin binding.

Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary binding site in $T1$ which mediates its interaction with $T2$ and plakoglobin.

Recently we have identified an alpha-catenin binding site in beta-catenin and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and $T1$$T2$, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 $T1$ molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric $T2$ to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble actin, cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and profilin were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow. Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this $T1$ may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, $T2$, and profilin. We examined the axonal transport of actin and its monomer binding proteins, actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin, in the chicken sciatic nerve following injection of [35S]methionine into the lumbar spinal cord.

Role of cofilin in epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in $T1$-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the $T2$ dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and $T1$$T2$-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and ADF but not in $T1$, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of $T2$ in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Analysis of various truncated alpha-catenin molecules revealed that amino-terminal residues 48-163 are able to bind to beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and $T1$$T2$ and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa. Using an in vitro assay system involving bacterially expressed proteins, we localized a region in alpha-catenin required for molecular interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. When transfected into L cells expressing E-cadherin, the amino-terminal region of alpha-catenin (from residue 1 to 226) formed complexes with beta-catenin supporting the in vitro binding experiment results.

Analysis of the formation of the calf spleen complex in the presence of varying concentrations of divalent cations gave evidence for the presence of a high-affinity divalent-cation-binding site on the spleen actin (beta, gamma) which appears to regulate the interaction with profilin.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the $T1$ variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from $T2$ complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

How profilin promotes actin filament assembly in the presence of thymosin beta 4. The role of profilin in the regulation of actin assembly has been reexamined. When barbed ends are capped, profilin simply sequesters globular actin.

Fluorescent actin analogs with a high affinity for profilin in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of actin with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of actin assembly near the surface of the cell. To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and $T1$-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit $T2$.

Here, specific interactions between human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co-infected with RAD51 and RAD52 recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. Interaction of the yeast RAD51 and RAD52 proteins plays a crucial role in yeast DNA homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins. The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast $T1$$T2$ protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific. These results suggest that RAD52 may modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction.

Characterization of the interactions of $T1$ with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/$T2$. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with alpha-actinin. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in cofilin and $T1$ but not in actin, $T2$ and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Aip1p interacts with cofilin to disassemble actin filaments. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is disrupted by specific actin and $T1$$T2$ and cofilin mutations. A two-hybrid-based approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Here, we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.

Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to actin was 1 to 5.2.

Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and profilin.

To test for regional differences in the rates of synthesis and degradation of contractile proteins during normal physiological growth of the heart in vivo, fractional rates of protein accumulation and synthesis were assessed for total protein, myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain, phosphorylatable myosin light chain, and actin in the right and left ventricular free walls of growing, New Zealand White rabbits.

Reversible binding of actin to gelsolin and profilin in human platelet extracts. Sepharose beads coupled to either monoclonal anti-$T1$ antibodies or to polyproline were used to extract gelsolin and profilin, respectively, from EGTA-containing platelet extracts and determine the proportion of these molecules bound to $T2$ with sufficient affinity to withstand dilution (high-affinity complexes). Thrombin, within seconds, caused quantitative conversion of platelet profilin and gelsolin to high-affinity complexes with actin, but these complexes were not present 5 min after stimulation.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal regions of talin disrupt actin stress fibers when microinjected into human fibroblasts. These results show that the C-terminal actin-binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule. To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for $T1$ and $T2$ binding.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast $T1$ mutants with altered poly-L-proline and $T2$ binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Profilin is generally thought to regulate $T1$ polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and $T2$ raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. The actin-binding protein profilin binds to PIP2 and inhibits its hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.

Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae $T1$ and $T2$ in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human $T1$$T2$ almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

$T1$ appears to control at least four functions that collectively lead to actin-based motility: (1) initiation of $T2$ polymerization, (2) polarization of ActA function, (3) transformation of actin polymerization into a motile force and (4) acceleration of movement mediated by the host protein profilin.

All these results suggest that cofilin is a new type of actin-associated protein. The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric $T1$$T2$ inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl. The gel point assay using an actin cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the actin filaments and hence increases the filament number.

As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in $T1$ and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or cofilin may be responsible for the nuclear import of $T2$ in myogenic cells under certain conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two actin-binding proteins of low molecular weight with different functional activity, ADF and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide. In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10 actin molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric profilin to have an important influence on actin assembly. Kinetic simulation showed that the profilin exchanges between actin monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange. On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of $T1$$T2$ much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

Analysis of the formation of the calf spleen complex in the presence of varying concentrations of divalent cations gave evidence for the presence of a high-affinity divalent-cation-binding site on the spleen actin (beta, gamma) which appears to regulate the interaction with profilin. The interaction between calf spleen profilin and actin depends critically on the status of the C-terminus of the $T1$$T2$ profilin and actin depends critically on the status of the C-terminus of the actin, and in the case of profilin, the C-terminus is of great importance for the physiochemical behaviour of the protein.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, $T1$$T2$ (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC).

Actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin. These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to $T1$ and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect $T2$ activity.

Redundancy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 and MSH6 in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair.

Immunolocalization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44 has rarely been investigated in human cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In CC, membranous expression of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC. In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts.

These studies suggest that profilin and gelsolin may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the actin polymerization. This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.

In extracts from mouse brain, profilin I and $T1$$T2$ and profilin II can form complexes with regulators of endocytosis, synaptic vesicle recycling and actin assembly. In mouse brain profilin I and profilin II associate with regulators of the endocytic pathway and actin assembly. Our findings strongly suggest that in brain profilin I and profilin II complexes link the actin cytoskeleton and endocytic membrane flow, directing actin and clathrin assembly to distinct membrane domains.

Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary binding site in alpha-catenin which mediates its interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds either beta-catenin or plakoglobin, which both can assemble $T1$$T2$ or plakoglobin, which both can assemble alpha-catenin into the complex. Recently we have identified an alpha-catenin binding site in beta-catenin and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism.

Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with syntaxin 3, a t-SNARE localized to the apical plasma membrane. Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind $T1$$T2$ mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment. The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells. This implies that Munc18-2 function in apical membrane trafficking involves aspects independent of the syntaxin 3 interaction.

$T1$2/3 complex from Acanthamoeba binds profilin and cross-links $T2$ filaments. By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers. Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross-linked to the actin-binding site of profilin.

The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The interactions of yeast and human platelet $T1$$T2$ with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast profilin mutants with altered poly-L-proline and actin binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

Characterization of the interactions of alpha-catenin with alpha-actinin and beta-catenin/plakoglobin. In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with $T1$/plakoglobin and with $T2$. beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

Role of cofilin in $T1$-stimulated $T2$ polymerization and lamellipod protrusion. These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization. To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.
