The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with $T1$, $T2$, and plakoglobin. Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-catenin complexes.

These results suggest that cofilin provides an as yet missing link between functionally crucial T cell surface receptors and rearrangements of the $T1$$T2$ provides an as yet missing link between functionally crucial T cell surface receptors and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton.

Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not. The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of $T1$ from $T2$. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin.

Acanthamoeba profilin strongly inhibits in a concentration-dependent fashion the rate and extent of Acanthamoeba actin polymerization in 50 mM KCl. Addition of profilin to polymerized actin causes it to depolymerize until a new steady-state, dependent on profilin concentration, is achieved. Mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin: demonstration of actin species specificity and regulation by micromolar concentrations of MgCl2.

Data from affinity chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, covalent cross-linking, and fluorescence anisotropy show that profilin, thymosin beta(4), and actin form a ternary complex. Experiments using a peptide that corresponds to the N-terminus of thymosin beta(4) (residues 6-22) confirm the presence of an extensive binding surface between $T1$$T2$ (residues 6-22) confirm the presence of an extensive binding surface between actin and thymosin beta(4), and explain why thymosin beta(4) and profilin can bind simultaneously to actin.

Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not. The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from $T1$$T2$) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin.

The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and $T1$$T2$, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin. Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-catenin complexes.

This suggests that dephosphorylation of cofilin and destrin/ADF by TSH could be implicated in the disruption of $T1$$T2$ and destrin/ADF by TSH could be implicated in the disruption of actin-containing stress fibers and in the reorganization of microfilaments induced by this hormone.

Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit $T1$$T2$ form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.

Acanthamoeba profilin has similar but weaker effects on muscle actin, requiring 5 to 10 times more profilin than with amoeba actin. Acanthamoeba profilin strongly inhibits in a concentration-dependent fashion the rate and extent of Acanthamoeba $T1$$T2$ strongly inhibits in a concentration-dependent fashion the rate and extent of Acanthamoeba actin polymerization in 50 mM KCl. Addition of profilin to polymerized actin causes it to depolymerize until a new steady-state, dependent on profilin concentration, is achieved. Mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin: demonstration of actin species specificity and regulation by micromolar concentrations of MgCl2. MgCl2 strongly inhibits these effects of profilin, most likely by binding to the high-affinity divalent cation site on the actin.

The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin. Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, $T1$$T2$, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-catenin complexes.

In brush cells, villin and $T1$$T2$ and fimbrin are not only present in the actin filament core bundles of apical microvilli and their long rootlets but, in addition, both proteins are also associated with microvilli extending from the basolateral cell surface of the brush cells. In the present study we show that brush cells can be identified in tissue sections even at the light microscopic level by immunostaining with antibodies against villin and fimbrin, two proteins that crosslink actin filaments to form bundles.

Here we demonstrate that accessory receptor triggering induces the transient association of cofilin with the $T1$$T2$ with the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, we have shown that the small actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin represents a component of a co-stimulatory signaling pathway in human T cells. These results suggest that cofilin provides an as yet missing link between functionally crucial T cell surface receptors and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton.

However, these rod structures were not observed in response to $T1$, forskolin, or TPA, suggesting that dephosphorylation of cofilin correlates with the reorganization of actin microfilaments but not with the nuclear transport of $T2$.

Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not. The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of $T1$$T2$ was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin.

Here we demonstrate that accessory receptor triggering induces the transient association of cofilin with the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, we have shown that the small actin-depolymerizing protein $T1$$T2$-depolymerizing protein cofilin represents a component of a co-stimulatory signaling pathway in human T cells. These results suggest that cofilin provides an as yet missing link between functionally crucial T cell surface receptors and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton.

Acanthamoeba profilin has similar but weaker effects on muscle actin, requiring 5 to 10 times more $T1$$T2$ has similar but weaker effects on muscle actin, requiring 5 to 10 times more profilin than with amoeba actin. Acanthamoeba profilin strongly inhibits in a concentration-dependent fashion the rate and extent of Acanthamoeba actin polymerization in 50 mM KCl. Addition of profilin to polymerized actin causes it to depolymerize until a new steady-state, dependent on profilin concentration, is achieved. Mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin: demonstration of actin species specificity and regulation by micromolar concentrations of MgCl2. MgCl2 strongly inhibits these effects of profilin, most likely by binding to the high-affinity divalent cation site on the actin.

Data from affinity chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, covalent cross-linking, and fluorescence anisotropy show that profilin, thymosin beta(4), and actin form a ternary complex. Experiments using a peptide that corresponds to the N-terminus of thymosin beta(4) (residues 6-22) confirm the presence of an extensive binding surface between actin and thymosin beta(4), and explain why thymosin beta(4) and profilin can bind simultaneously to $T1$$T2$ can bind simultaneously to actin.

The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and $T1$$T2$, and plakoglobin. Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-catenin complexes.

Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with $T1$ were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the $T2$ tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not. The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin.

Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba $T1$$T2$ form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.

Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not. The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of $T1$ is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of alpha-catenin from $T2$. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin.

However, these rod structures were not observed in response to TSH, forskolin, or TPA, suggesting that dephosphorylation of cofilin correlates with the reorganization of actin microfilaments but not with the nuclear transport of cofilin. This suggests that dephosphorylation of cofilin and destrin/ADF by $T1$$T2$ and destrin/ADF by TSH could be implicated in the disruption of actin-containing stress fibers and in the reorganization of microfilaments induced by this hormone.

Acanthamoeba profilin has similar but weaker effects on muscle actin, requiring 5 to 10 times more profilin than with amoeba actin. Acanthamoeba profilin strongly inhibits in a concentration-dependent fashion the rate and extent of Acanthamoeba actin polymerization in 50 mM KCl. Addition of profilin to polymerized actin causes it to depolymerize until a new steady-state, dependent on profilin concentration, is achieved. Mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin: demonstration of actin species specificity and regulation by micromolar concentrations of MgCl2. MgCl2 strongly inhibits these effects of profilin, most likely by binding to the high-affinity divalent cation site on the $T1$$T2$, most likely by binding to the high-affinity divalent cation site on the actin.

Data from affinity chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, covalent cross-linking, and fluorescence anisotropy show that profilin, thymosin beta(4), and actin form a ternary complex. Experiments using a peptide that corresponds to the N-terminus of thymosin beta(4) (residues 6-22) confirm the presence of an extensive binding surface between $T1$ and thymosin beta(4), and explain why thymosin beta(4) and profilin can bind simultaneously to $T2$.

Acanthamoeba profilin has similar but weaker effects on muscle actin, requiring 5 to 10 times more $T1$$T2$, requiring 5 to 10 times more profilin than with amoeba actin. Acanthamoeba profilin strongly inhibits in a concentration-dependent fashion the rate and extent of Acanthamoeba actin polymerization in 50 mM KCl. Addition of profilin to polymerized actin causes it to depolymerize until a new steady-state, dependent on profilin concentration, is achieved. Mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin: demonstration of actin species specificity and regulation by micromolar concentrations of MgCl2. MgCl2 strongly inhibits these effects of profilin, most likely by binding to the high-affinity divalent cation site on the actin.

The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin. Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and $T1$$T2$ forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-catenin complexes.

The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin. Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and $T1$ which are independent from the $T2$-catenin complexes.

Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of $T1$ with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of $T2$ from E-cadherin was not. The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin.

Acanthamoeba profilin has similar but weaker effects on muscle actin, requiring 5 to 10 times more $T1$ than with amoeba $T2$. Acanthamoeba profilin strongly inhibits in a concentration-dependent fashion the rate and extent of Acanthamoeba actin polymerization in 50 mM KCl. Addition of profilin to polymerized actin causes it to depolymerize until a new steady-state, dependent on profilin concentration, is achieved. Mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin: demonstration of actin species specificity and regulation by micromolar concentrations of MgCl2. MgCl2 strongly inhibits these effects of profilin, most likely by binding to the high-affinity divalent cation site on the actin.

An assembly of the UL5 and UL52 subunits retains both enzymic activities, and the UL8 protein has been implicated in modulating these functions, facilitating efficient nuclear uptake of the complex and interacting with other viral DNA replication proteins. Deletion mutants of the herpes simplex virus type 1 UL8 protein: effect on DNA synthesis and ability to interact with and influence the intracellular localization of the UL5 and UL52 proteins. The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) helicase-primase, an essential component of the viral DNA replication machinery, is a trimeric complex of the virus-coded $T1$, $T2$, and UL52 proteins.

Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not. The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from $T1$$T2$ (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin.

Acanthamoeba profilin has similar but weaker effects on muscle actin, requiring 5 to 10 times more profilin than with amoeba $T1$$T2$ has similar but weaker effects on muscle actin, requiring 5 to 10 times more profilin than with amoeba actin. Acanthamoeba profilin strongly inhibits in a concentration-dependent fashion the rate and extent of Acanthamoeba actin polymerization in 50 mM KCl. Addition of profilin to polymerized actin causes it to depolymerize until a new steady-state, dependent on profilin concentration, is achieved. Mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba profilin: demonstration of actin species specificity and regulation by micromolar concentrations of MgCl2. MgCl2 strongly inhibits these effects of profilin, most likely by binding to the high-affinity divalent cation site on the actin.

The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin. Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of $T1$, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-$T2$ complexes.

Acanthamoeba profilin has similar but weaker effects on muscle actin, requiring 5 to 10 times more profilin than with amoeba actin. Acanthamoeba profilin strongly inhibits in a concentration-dependent fashion the rate and extent of Acanthamoeba actin polymerization in 50 mM KCl. Addition of profilin to polymerized actin causes it to depolymerize until a new steady-state, dependent on profilin concentration, is achieved. Mechanism of action of Acanthamoeba $T1$: demonstration of $T2$ species specificity and regulation by micromolar concentrations of MgCl2. MgCl2 strongly inhibits these effects of profilin, most likely by binding to the high-affinity divalent cation site on the actin.

Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not. The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from $T1$$T2$ from E-cadherin.

Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not.

Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba $T1$$T2$ fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.

Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not. The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of $T1$$T2$ is achieved by EGFR upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin.

The results indicate that (a) plakoglobin and beta-catenin differ in their nuclear translocation and complexing with LEF-1 and vinculin; (b) LEF-1-dependent transactivation is preferentially driven by beta-catenin; and (c) the cytoplasmic partners of beta-catenin, cadherin and $T1$$T2$, cadherin and alpha-catenin, can sequester it to the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional activity.

The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin. The APC protein and $T1$$T2$ protein and E-cadherin form similar but independent complexes with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin. Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin which are independent from the cadherin-catenin complexes.
